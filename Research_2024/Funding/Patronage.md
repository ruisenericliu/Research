robotics funding is very similar to a medieval patronage system. How do we progress such a system to a more modern economic system, like guilds or free markets?

It’s an interesting comparison! Today’s robotics funding has similarities to medieval patronage, as funding is often dependent on large “patrons” like government agencies, academic grants, or private investors who decide which projects get backing based on their strategic priorities. This can limit diversity in research and lead to projects that align more with the interests of funders than of innovators. Here’s how transitioning to a more "guild" or "free market" model might look:
 
**1. Creating Robotics “Guilds”**  
Guilds in the medieval sense were organizations of skilled artisans who pooled resources, shared knowledge, and set standards for quality and pricing. In robotics, such a system could manifest as:

- **Collaborative Industry Networks:** Groups of roboticists or startups join forces to secure group funding, lobby for favorable policies, or gain collective bargaining power in sourcing components and technologies.
- **Open Knowledge Sharing:** This would include standardized platforms and collaborative R&D hubs where roboticists freely share advances, much like guild members shared trade secrets within their own circle.
- **Quality Standards and Certifications:** Guilds would establish and uphold certain standards in robotics, so these “guild-certified” standards help provide a baseline for quality and reliability, leading to better public trust and product adoption.  
**2. Transitioning to a Free-Market Model**  
Moving to a more open market for funding in robotics requires making it easier for independent researchers and smaller startups to find financial backing without needing patron-like sponsors.
 
- **Crowdsourced Funding Platforms:** Platforms specifically tailored for robotics could allow everyday investors or users to directly fund projects. Like Kickstarter, but with tiers of commitment that could even include equity in projects. - **Government Policy Incentives:** Governments could provide grants or tax incentives for private investors who support a diverse array of robotics projects, including small or open-source ventures. - **More Accessible Private Capital:** This might involve restructuring venture capital or private equity so that a wider array of robotics projects, including smaller ones, become attractive investments. Here, “mini-IPOs” could let small investors back robotics startups early on. - **Robot-as-a-Service (RaaS) Models:** Instead of needing major funding to develop and sell a robot, startups could adopt service-based approaches where they deploy their robots for clients and receive steady income through service contracts. This lessens the dependency on up-front capital for full-scale development.       

**3. Building a Hybrid Model**  
A hybrid approach could bring together aspects of guilds and free markets while retaining certain aspects of patronage where useful:
 
- **Incubators and Accelerators:** These could act like guilds for early-stage roboticists, providing funding and support but also promoting knowledge-sharing and cooperative development. This model is closer to today’s tech accelerator programs. - **Public-Private Partnerships:** Funded by governments but administered by industry, these partnerships could bring together players from all areas of robotics, ensuring access to resources while decentralizing funding decisions. - **Blockchain and DAOs for Funding Pools:** Blockchain tech could facilitate a decentralized, transparent system where stakeholders with diverse interests back projects by contributing to a shared funding pool. This creates a more distributed form of "patronage" while democratizing project selection and investment.

By enabling diverse funding sources, standardizing collaboration, and decentralizing access, robotics could thrive in a more modern economic structure that draws from the best of guilds and free markets, reducing dependency on the current patronage system.
