Today, we’re excited to announce [#AlphaFold](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/hashtag/?keywords=alphafold&highlightedUpdateUrns=urn%3Ali%3Aactivity%3A7193989132157632512) 3: our AI model for predicting the structures and interactions of all life’s molecules. 🧬
 
Here’s what you need to know:
 
🌐 By accurately modeling the shapes of proteins, DNA, RNA, and more, this next generation model could help scientists unlock new discoveries in biology.
 
🔬 We have also launched AlphaFold Server, a free platform that scientists around the world can use for non-commercial research. They can harness AlphaFold 3’s predictions and test hypotheses with just a few clicks - no matter their technical expertise.
 
💊 [Isomorphic Labs](https://www.linkedin.com/company/isomorphic-labs/) Isomorphic labs is applying this next generation model to design new drugs and tackle real-world therapeutic challenges
 
🧪 Millions of researchers around the world have used AlphaFold predictions in areas like developing an experimental malaria vaccine, designing plastic-eating enzymes and more.

AlphaFold-3 is out! What's new is that AlphaFold-3 uses diffusion to "render" the molecular structure. It starts from a fuzzy cloud of atoms and then materializes the molecule gradually through denoising. We live on a timeline where learnings from Llama and Sora can inform and accelerate life sciences.
 
I find this level of generality absolutely mind-boggling. The same transformer+diffusion backbone that generates fancy pixels can also imagine proteins, as long as you convert the data to sequences of floats accordingly.
 
We are not there yet at a single AGI model, but we have successfully built a menu of general-purpose AI recipes that transfer training techniques, data pipelines, and neural architectures across domains that don't seem related. This should not work, but thank god it does!
 
Congrats to DeepMind and Isomorphic Labs!
