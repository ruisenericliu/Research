Excellent piece by Noah Smith on techno-optimism.  
So many good points.
 
Like Noah, I'm a humanist who subscribes to both Positive and Normative forms of Active Techno-Optimism.
 
Quote: "Techno-optimism is thus much more than an argument about the institutions of today or the resource allocations of today. It’s a faith in humanity — and all sentient beings — propelling ourselves forward into the infinite tomorrow."
 
A few of my famous friends and colleagues have expressed hesitations about technological risks. It is not because they are techno-pessimists. They do believe in the ability of technological progress, and AI in particular, to improve human condition. But they doubt that current economic and political institutions, and humanity as a whole, will be capable of using it for good.
 
I also like this bit:  
"So anyone who thinks that technology is pushed forward solely by scrappy inventors in their garages, while government and big business merely parasitizes off of their labors, is deeply wrong. And anyone who thinks that technology is pushed forward solely by government planners, while the private sector merely parasitizes off of government’s efforts, is also deeply wrong."
 
People often forget that most of the technologies that power the modern world were invented in publicly-funded university labs, or industry research labs of dominant companies, such as AT&T Bell Labs, IBM research, and Xerox PARC, even if many products derived from these inventions were later developed and deployed by smaller companies or garage-dwelling tinkerers.
