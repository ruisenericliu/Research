Over the weekend, I built a Perplexity clone using Google DeepMind's Gemini 2.0 + Grounding, and the wildest part? Replit's Agent wrote ALL of the code within 2 hours.
 
Since launching, it has received over 60,000 users, 400 stars on GitHub, and has users worldwide.
 
Crazy what you can build with AI in just a couple of hours and awesome to see that Google has all the pieces to make AI search incredible. Hope they productize it soon!
