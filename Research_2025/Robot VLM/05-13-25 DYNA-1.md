At Dyna Robotics, we obsess over one question: What’s the single most important thing that needs to be true to unlock unlimited demand for robots?
 
After talking to hundreds of customers, the answer is clear: PERFORMANCE — high throughput and high-quality output, consistently. Performance has been our sole focus since Dyna’s inception. Traditional ML falters in dynamic settings and over long-horizon tasks, so we embraced foundation models to create robots that adapt to new environments and tasks right out of the box. Yet, until now, no robotics foundation model has proven to be production-ready.
 
Today, we’re thrilled to turn the page on embodied-AI manipulation with a major technical breakthrough that finally delivers PERFORMANCE in real-world conditions.
 
This marks a critical milestone in embodied AI: the beginning of true commercial viability. We’re calling this model Dynamism v1 (DYNA-1) — a name that reflects our belief that this is the first step toward widespread commercialization of embodied AI. We hope ongoing innovations in embodied AI can unlock domestic production across industries—and in turn, help ease global trade tensions.
 
Some may ask: I’ve seen better robot videos, what’s the big deal?
 
The difference is precisely in PERFORMANCE. Most demo videos are cherry-picked clips from dozens of retries. Behind the scenes, they fail to:  
1. Run reliably for an extended period of time (often getting stuck in corner cases)  
2. Move at speeds that enable economic throughput (10% of human speed)  
3. Deliver consistent, high-quality output  
4. Adapt outside their training environments
 
Unlike prior systems, DYNA-1 has demonstrated:  
1. 99.4% success rate with zero human intervention and automated error handling  
2. 60% human throughput speed  
3. 4.3/5 quality rating (set by the client)  
4. Zero shot environment generalization
 
Mastering napkin folding won’t transform daily life, but it marks a pivotal step towards the widespread deployment of embodied AI. We’re unlocking more skills to ship into more commercial environments in the coming weeks & months.
 
We’re hiring people who are obsessed with their work & are willing to put in the hours to change the world. We left a recruiting easter egg in the video for those who want a challenge.
