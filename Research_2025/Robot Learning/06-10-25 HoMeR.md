Excited to share HoMeR: Learning In-the-Wild Mobile Manipulation via Hybrid Imitation and Whole-Body Control. (Website: [homer-manip.github.io](http://homer-manip.github.io))
 
How can we move beyond static-arm lab setups and learn robot policies in our messy homes? We introduce HoMeR, an imitation learning agent for in-the-wild mobile manipulation.  
---
 
In real homes, both data collection and policy learning are hard —  
workspaces are large, task horizons are long, and scenes are too diverse to fully cover. Many tasks, like wiping a table or opening a door, also require coordinated whole-body movement — not just arm motion.
 
We address these challenges with HoMeR, a hybrid IL agent that leverages:  
• point clouds + images as input
 
And outputs:  
• absolute poses for long-range movement  
• relative poses for fine-grained manip  
all executed via a whole-body controller.
 
Specifically, HoMeR builds on our prior work SPHINX ([sphinx-manip.github.io](http://sphinx-manip.github.io)), extending it to the Tidybot++ platform ( [http://tidybot2.github.io/](http://tidybot2.github.io/)) with a whole-body controller based on the Mink library ( [https://lnkd.in/gRj7qVYp](https://lnkd.in/gRj7qVYp)).

Results at a Glance:  
1️⃣ From just 20 demonstrations, HoMeR achieves 79% success, outperforming baselines that lack hybrid actions or whole-body control by 29% across 6 simulated and real-world tasks.  
2️⃣ HoMER also can be conditioned on keypoints derived from VLMs, enabling generalization to unseen visual appearances and clutter.  
3️⃣ We also release an iphone-based interface for intuitive whole-body teleoperation, with self-collision avoidance between the arm, base, and external camera mounts.
