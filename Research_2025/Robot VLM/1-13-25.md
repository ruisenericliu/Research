Can generalist robot 🤖 policies understand heterogeneous multimodal sensors?  
Introducing FuSe, a novel finetuning recipe allowing VLAs to reason across 👁️ vision, 🤏 touch, 🔊 sound & 🗣️ language, enabling queries "pick the object that feels like🍍 but is brown" (hint: pinecone)
 
Interacting in the 🌎 is a multisensory experience, but pretrained generalist policies only use vision+proprioception. How can we connect the semantic knowledge 🧠 of generalist policies with new heterogeneous modalities? We find that natural language acts as an excellent bridge 🌉
 
How does it work?  
Our multimodal VLA finetuning recipe combines two auxiliary losses:  
1️⃣ A contrastive loss to maximize mutual information between views & semantics of the same scene  
2️⃣ A language generation loss to predict high-level semantics across modality combinations
 
The best part? VLAs can now handle multimodal and cross-modal prompting for new sensing modalities and generate object descriptions solely from touch! 🤏 Perfect for partially observable tasks like grasping items from a shopping bag 🛍️🤖
 
How does it perform?  
Over 1000 real-world evals. 100+ unseen objects. Challenging tasks, some with partial observability, requiring joint reasoning across vision 👁️, language 🗣️, touch 🤏 & audio 🔊  
FuSe models outperforms strong baselines by a large margin 📈 + results in paper
 
How to use it? It's all on HuggingFace! 🤗  
✅ 27K robot trajectories across diverse envs with touch 🤏, audio 🔊, language 🗣️ etc.  
✅ Open-source code & model weights  
✅ A 3B PaliGemma-FuSe VLA ready to go 🚀
 
Really excited about this work! While single-image-based transformer models have dominated due to easier data scaling and data scarcity for touch sensing 🤏 & co, a truly generalist robot policy 🤖 will need to understand multiple sensing modalities for robust decision-making 🔍
