|**What's New**|
|Researchers from NYU, MIT, and Google introduce a framework that improves inference-time scaling for diffusion models. Diffusion models generate images, audio, and videos by denoising noisy data. Traditional methods fail to improve performance when you add more denoising steps during inference.<br><br>  <br><br>**Key Features**<br><br>- **Search Operations**: The system explores different noise candidates to find the best starting point for generating high-quality samples.<br>- **Fixed Denoising Steps**: The number of denoising steps is kept constant at **250** to avoid diminishing returns.<br>- **Verifiers**: The framework uses two verifiers—**Inception Score (IS)** and **Fréchet Inception Distance (FID)**—to assess the quality of generated images during the search process.<br><br>  <br><br>**Noise Optimization**  <br>Diffusion models use random noise as a starting point for generating outputs. Some random noises result in better outputs than others. The new approach systematically searches for the best initial noise to improve results during inference.<br><br>  <br><br>**Denoising Limitations**  <br>In a typical diffusion process, noise is progressively cleaned up in steps. Increasing the number of denoising steps (or **NFEs**) improves output quality, but only up to a point. Eventually, adding more steps doesn’t make much difference.<br><br>  <br><br>**Search-Based Approach**  <br>Instead of just increasing the number of denoising steps, this framework treats the process as a search for the optimal noise. It uses a search-based methodology to find better starting noise, improving the generation quality without retraining the model.<br><br>  <br><br>**Test Results**<br><br>- **Random Search**: A Random Search algorithm selects the best noise candidates.<br>- **Improved Sample Quality**: The framework consistently produced higher-quality results across multiple benchmarks.<br>- **Performance Metrics**: ImageReward and Verifier Ensemble performed best in quality across all tests, while ImageReward excelled in text-prompt accuracy.|
