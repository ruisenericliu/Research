Embodied Gaussians ([https://lnkd.in/girK-jdp](https://lnkd.in/girK-jdp)) is a simulator that combines Gaussian Splatting (GSplat) with physics-based simulation (NVIDIA's Warp)
 
🔗 GitHub: [https://lnkd.in/gWZHeCB4](https://lnkd.in/gWZHeCB4)
 
Key Features:  
✅ Gaussian Splatting + Physics Integration – Simulate dynamic interactions with realistic rendering.  
✅ Virtual Visual Forces – Correct the positions of objects using real observations  
✅ Parallelizable Environments – Scale efficiently for complex scenarios.  
✅ Virtual Camera Rendering – Attach and render multiple cameras in parallel for diverse viewpoints.
 
Coming Soon:  
🌊 Deformables :(
