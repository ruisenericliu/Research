Macroeconomics of AI

Using existing estimates on exposure to AI and productivity improvements at the task level, these macroeconomic  
effects appear nontrivial but modest—**no more than a 0.66% increase in total factor productivity** (TFP) over  
10 years.

I advances are unlikely to increase inequality as much as previous automation technologies  
because their impact is more equally distributed across demographic groups, but there is also no evidence  
that AI will reduce labor income inequality. Instead, AI is predicted to widen the gap between capital and  
labor income
   

Goldman Sachs (2023) predicts  
a 7% increase in global GDP, equivalent to $7 trillion, and a **1.5% per annum increase in**  
**US productivity growth** over a 10-year period
 
Tasks:  
mid-level clerical functions, text summary, data classification, advanced pattern recog-  
nition, and computer vision tasks
 
I take Eloundou et al.’s estimates of tasks that are exposed to AI (without distinguishing  
automation vs. task complementarities). I then aggregate this to the occupational level and  
weight the importance of each occupation by its wage bill share in the US economy
 
I take the average **labor cost savings to be 27%**—the average of the estimates in Noy and  
Zhang (2023) and Brynjolfsson et al. (2023)—and turn this into overall cost savings using  
industry labor shares, which imply **average overall cost savings of 14.4%**
   

Wage Inequality  
AI can enable productivity increases in tasks currently produced by labor (won't help wage growth)
 
If AI generates large productivity gains, it may increase wages even though it reduces  
the labor share (Acemoglu and Restrepo, 2018, 2019b). - (won't help wage growth)
 
As already discussed, some early studies show that within narrow occupations, lower-  
performing or lower-expertise workers are the ones benefiting from generative A
 
If AI created new (good) tasks, these would reduce inequality between capital and  
labor, and if enough new tasks were targeting lower-skill workers, this could also reduce  
labor income inequality (Acemoglu and Restrepo, 2018)
 
Misc:  
Participants were given the task of implementing a HTTP server on JavaScript, a popular language for which  
resources and subroutines are readily available, and GPT-3 was already trained on these  
resources. They compare the experimental treatment group to a control group that is  
not given access to GitHub Copilot. They find that the treatment group performed  
the assigned tasks on average 55.8% faster than the control group
 
The treatment group is given access to and encouraged to use ChatGPT-3.5, while the  
control group is not. They verify that there is very low usage of ChatGPT in the control  
group. They estimate that ChatGPT enables, on average, 40% faster completion of  
the task at hand. They also estimate an 18% improvement in quality scores, as judged  
by peers and ChatGPT-based scoring of the output. In their case, too, the gains come  
mostly from subjects that performed less well before the experiment.
   

I interpret all three studies as providing labor cost savings from AI, broadly construed—in  
particular, meaning that **all three studies include both automation and task complementarity**  
**elements.**
