🚀 We are releasing LocoMuJoCo2 — An extensive library for whole-body imitation & RL targeting both humanoids and quadrupeds!
 
🔍 Key Highlights:  
- Supports MuJoCo and MJX (single and parallel environments)  
- Clean JAX implementations of popular algorithms: PPO, GAIL, AMP, and DeepMimic  
- Over 22,000 high-quality motion capture trajectories (AMASS, LAFAN1, native LocoMuJoCo) retargeted for each humanoid  
- Robot-to-robot retargeting: Retarget any dataset from one robot to another, regardless of DoF or size!  
- Add your humanoid and get immediate access to all motion capture datasets!  
- Modular design: Customize and reuse components like observation types, rewards, and domain randomization  
- ⚡ Lightning-fast training by JIT-compiling the environment and algorithm into a single function, allowing you to train policies in under 20 minutes on an RTX 4090!
