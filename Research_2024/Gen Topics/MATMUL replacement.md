|**What's New**|
|The paper "Scalable MatMul-free Language Modeling" went completely viral on Twitter, generating 2.3 million impressions due to its innovative approach that eliminates matrix multiplication (MatMul) from LLMs.<br><br>  <br><br>Traditionally, MatMul is essential for processing dense layers and implementing self-attention mechanisms in neural networks, but it demands substantial computational power and memory.<br><br>  <br><br>**Problem Addressed**  <br>LLMs typically require MatMul for their operations, which significantly limits their deployment to environments equipped with high-end hardware due to the high computational and memory demands. <br><br>  <br><br>**Solution**  <br>The research introduces a method that replaces MatMul with simpler computational techniques, dramatically reducing resource consumption while maintaining model performance.<br><br>  <br><br>**How It Works**<br><br>- **In Dense Layers:** The method substitutes MatMul with ternary accumulations where the weights are only -1, 0, or +1. This reduces the complexity of calculations.<br>- **For Self-Attention Mechanisms:** It utilizes a MatMul-free Linear Gated Recurrent Unit (MLGRU) that operates solely on element-wise products.<br>- **In Channel Mixing:** It employs modified Gated Linear Units (GLUs) that integrate BitLinear layers with ternary weights, efficiently managing data integration across channels with reduced computational overhead.<br><br>**Impact of the Innovation**  <br>Removing MatMul from the calculations in large language models means these models don't need powerful computers to run. This change allows them to work on simpler devices, like smaller servers or even some personal computers, making advanced AI tools available to more people and places.<br><br>  <br><br>**Performance Metrics**<br><br>- **Memory Reduction:** Memory usage during inference sees a reduction by more than 10 times compared to unoptimized models.<br>- **Efficiency Gains:** Training speed increases by 25.6%, and overall memory requirements drop by 61% relative to conventional approaches.<br>- **Hardware Optimization:** Custom FPGA accelerators demonstrate the practicality of this method by processing billion-parameter models with just 13 watts of power.|
