SmolVLA achieves best-in-class performance and inference speed, and the best part? It’s trained entirely on open-source datasets from the 🤖 LeRobot project hosted on the Hugging Face Hub.
 
🔍 Why is SmolVLA so good?
 
Turns out that pretraining on a large, diverse and noisy collection of real-world community robotics data leads to better generalization and control. We saw a 26% boost in task success rate simply from adding community dataset pretraining!
 
⚡ Why is SmolVLA so fast?
 
1. We halved the size of SmolVLM and extract intermediate representations  
2. Introduced interleaved cross- and self-attention layers in the action expert  
3. Enabled asynchronous inference so the robot acts and reacts simultaneously
 
💡 Unlike most academic datasets, these community-contributed datasets are naturally diverse:  
✅ Multiple robots, camera angles, and manipulation tasks  
✅ Real-world messiness and complexity  
✅ Crowd-sourced and community-cleaned using Qwen2.5-VL for high-quality task descriptions
 
🌍 SmolVLA is a step toward making robotics research more affordable, reproducible, and collaborative.
