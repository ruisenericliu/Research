How are Vision Language Models trained? 🖼️ Qwen 2.5-VL demonstrates state-of-the-art performance through dynamic resolution processing, absolute time encoding for videos, and a redesigned Vision Transformer in 3B/7B/72B variants for edge and cloud deployment. 👀
 
Pre-training (Three-Phase):  
\> Phase 1 (ViT Only): Train only the ViT on image captions, visual knowledge, and OCR data (1.5T tokens, sequence length 8192).
 
\> Phase 2 (Multimodal): Unfreeze all parameters. Train on interleaved image-text data, VQA, video grounding, agent-based interaction data, and pure text data (2T tokens, sequence length 8192).
 
\> Phase 3 (Long-Context): Train on long video, long agent, and long document data (0.6T tokens, sequence length 32,768).
   

Post-training (SFT & DPO):  
\> Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT): Fine-tune the model (with ViT frozen) on a 2 million instruction pairs on VQA, Document processing and OCR, Grounding, Video analysis, and Agent interactions, and more.
 
\> Direct Preference Optimization (DPO): Align the model with human preferences using image-text and pure text data (with ViT frozen)
