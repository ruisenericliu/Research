Generative AI will make a lot of traditional robotics approaches obsolete.
 
This was the question debated this past Monday at the start of ICRA 2024. It was a great way to start the week and saw a room overflowing with attendees, sitting on every available floor space. [Ken Goldberg](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ACoAAAsU45sBhICLgZ4rvVhxt8EaMQHo9Fj03xc) was a fantastic moderator between the two sides. [Jeannette Bohg](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ACoAAAk83hcBkKujsSIFBb3sotrJJu3t0Z5xB4s) and [Harold Soh](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ACoAAAFnNgQBoOBHc_0i0CyHYxeqF0Dzssalg-0) had the wind in their sails as they represented the pro-Gen AI side while [Nadia Figueroa](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ACoAAALqaKQBtkjImZR7S1jubMEYvMwc8wv5-ow) and [Odest Chadwicke Jenkins](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ACoAAAA7FxsB3TSX-7vdV1MFB1siw-GqwOBxSGs) pushed back and argued that many parts of traditional robotics are here to stay.
 
While the ultimate consensus seemed to fall somewhere in-between the two extremes, highlighting that hybrid systems could be a strong path forward, a number of the pro and con arguments did stick with me as I moved into the rest of the week at ICRA. Today’s students are thinking and building AI-first, rather than leaning on traditional robotics technologies. This will only increase adoption for Gen-AI technologies as they move further into their careers. Meanwhile, would you trust Gen-ai of today completely with the safety of your colleagues or family members? Traditional robotics approaches can act as checks and guard rails to support safe and reliable systems, and help build and organize the data that we use to train our future models. However, Harold argued that we are willing to accept some risks from technologies that we don’t fully understand if it can provide tremendous value to society, creating an allegory between the black box nature of Gen-AI and the still not fully understood general anesthesia. Final point, regardless of the future makeup of Gen-AI versus traditional robotics approaches, the way we interact, plan and program robot tasks will look very different in the near future.
 
Thanks to the organizers for putting on such an engaging event and what do you all think?
