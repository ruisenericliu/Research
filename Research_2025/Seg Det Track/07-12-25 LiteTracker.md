🎉 LiteTracker is accepted to MICCAI 2025!
 
LiteTracker is a low-latency tissue tracking method designed for real-time surgical applications.
 
It reframes tissue tracking as a long-term point tracking problem, extending the CoTracker3 architecture with a set of training-free, runtime optimizations — addressing the latency-accuracy tradeoff bottleneck head-on.
 
Key highlights:  
🎞️ Frame-by-frame, low-latency tracking on commercial GPUs  
🚀 \>7× faster than its predecessor and \>2× faster than current SOTA  
🤝 Compatible with CoTracker3 weights — no retraining needed  
📊 High accuracy tracking & occlusion prediction on STIR and SuPer
