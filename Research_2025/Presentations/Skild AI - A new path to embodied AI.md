Objective; robotics that can do thousands of tasks
 
Magic Sauce  
Large Diverse Dataset  
Large Expressive Models  
Broad Generalization
 
Still thinking about data - chicken and egg problem of data aggregation  
Hard part in robotics is robotics, not language  
Moravec's Paradox
 
Proposal - use alternate sources of data that can scale robotics

1. Simulation
2. Human Videos
 
Sim:  
RMA: Rapid Motor Adaptation (2021)  
Extreme Parkour with Legged Robots
 
Human videos:  
WHILR: Human-to-Robot Imitation in the Wild (2022) - Human priors + robot real world curiosity -  
Structured world models from human videos (RSS 2023)  
Affordances from human videos as a versatile representation for robotics
      

Fast forward 3 years, generalization is mostly limited to pick and place (not much better than dex-net, 2017)
