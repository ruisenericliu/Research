I’m excited to kick off the first of our short courses focused on agents, starting with Building Agentic RAG with LlamaIndex, taught by [Jerry Liu](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ACoAAA9C_5MBsb5dPQ5at3QKbGwJ6-V5xHcsvUg), CEO of [LlamaIndex](https://www.linkedin.com/company/llamaindex/).
 
This covers an important shift in RAG (retrieval augmented generation), in which rather than having the developer write explicit routines to retrieve information to feed into the LLM context, we instead build a RAG agent that that has access to tools for retrieving information. This lets the agent decide what information to fetch, and enables it to answer more complex questions using multi-step reasoning.
 
In detail, you'll learn about:  
- Routing: Where your agent will use decision-making to route requests to multiple tools.  
- Tool Use: Where you'll create an interface for agents to select what tool (function call) to use as well as generate the right arguments.  
- Multi-step reasoning with tool use: Where you'll use an LLM to carry out multiple steps of reasoning, while retaining memory throughout the process.
 
You’ll also learn how to step through what your agent is doing to debug and improve it iteratively.
 
It’s an exciting time to build agents. Sign up and get started here! [https://lnkd.in/gmvEDidg](https://lnkd.in/gmvEDidg)
