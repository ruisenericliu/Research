|**Problem**  <br>LLMs inevitably hallucinate due to fundamental mathematical and logical limitations. The paper proves hallucinations are structural and cannot be eliminated through architectural improvements, dataset enhancements, or fact-checking mechanisms.<br><br>  <br><br>**Solution**  <br>The authors introduce the concept of "Structural Hallucinations" and provide mathematical proofs using computational theory and Gödel's First Incompleteness Theorem. They demonstrate undecidability in key LLM processes: training data completeness, information retrieval, intent classification, output generation, and fact-checking.<br><br>  <br><br>**Results**  <br>The paper proves that every stage of LLM processing has a non-zero probability of producing hallucinations. It illustrates these concepts using popular LLMs (OpenAI, Gemini, Claude) on a specific prompt, showing deviation from expected responses.|
