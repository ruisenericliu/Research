|**Training LLMs over Neurally Compressed Text**|
|Google introduces Equal-Info Windows, a method for training large language models on neurally compressed text. It outperforms byte-level baselines in perplexity and inference speed but has higher perplexity than subword tokenizers. <br><br>  <br><br>This method reduces sequence lengths, leading to lower latency. At 2 billion parameters, it achieves perplexity close to that of SentencePiece tokenization with reduced computational demands for inference.|
