Annoyed by having to retrain your entire policy just because your reward weights did not quite work on the real robot? 🤖
 
We are excited to share our SIGGRAPH 2025 paper,  
“AMOR: Adaptive Character Control through Multi-Objective Reinforcement Learning”  
Lucas Alegre*, Agon Serifi*, Ruben Grandia, David Müller, Espen Knoop, Moritz Baecher
 
AMOR trains a single policy conditioned on reward weights and motion context, letting you fine-tune the reward after training.  
Want smoother motions? Better accuracy? Just adjust the weights — no retraining needed!
 
A base policy with uniform weights might fail on challenging motions, but with a few weight tweaks, it nails them. Like this double spin. 🌀😵‍💫
 
Curious how tuning weights mid-motion can help improve the sim-to-real gap and unlock dynamic, expressive behaviors?
