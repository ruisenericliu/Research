Highlights for researchers  
• State-of-the-art sensor suite featuring an RGB camera, 6DOF SLAM cameras, eye tracking cameras, spatial microphones, IMUs, barometer, magnetometer, and GNSS + a new PPG sensor (heart rate) and contact microphone.  
• Ultra low-power and on-device machine perception for SLAM, eye tracking, hand tracking, and speech recognition using Meta’s custom silicon.  
• Capable of six to eight hours of continuous use.  
• Open-ear force-canceling speakers, enabling user-in-the-loop system prototyping.
 
We’re excited to see how researchers at Meta and beyond will leverage Aria Gen 2 to pave the way for future innovations that will shape the next computing platform.
