**Our Take**: Aircraft are undoubtedly important assets but at a time when munitions are acknowledged as being in critically short supply, the cuts to those accounts are not encouraging. We sympathize with HAC-D that there is carryover funding on multiple munition accounts but given DoD’s past inconsistent history with surging and then withdrawing munition funding - we need to see steady funding here.  
We would like to see HAC-D treat munitions the same way it treats F-35s. The F-35 is currently experiencing major delays and the government has stopped accepting jets until critical upgrades are complete. This has resulted in [aircraft stacking up](https://news.bgov.com/bloomberg-government-news/f-35-planes-stacking-up-on-tarmac-with-delays-in-key-upgrades) on the flight line in Fort Worth. Yet, HAC-D has proposed adding eight additional aircraft to the President’s Budget request despite this situation. Let’s give munitions the same benefit of the doubt to keep the pipeline flowing and contractors motivated.

HAC-D demonstrated significant support for the various innovation initiatives that have been initiated across DoD even coining a new term “**Defense Innovation Community of Entities (DICE).**” [HAC-D](https://appropriations.house.gov/subcommittees/defense-118th-congress) definitely has the right vision.  
_The Committee's prioritization of innovation aims to deliver acquisition solutions faster to rapidly field capabilities to the warfighter. Through increasing competition, as proven throughout history, technological advancement will accelerate, and costs will decrease._
