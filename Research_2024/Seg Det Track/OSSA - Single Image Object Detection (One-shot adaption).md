🦴 Single-Image Object Detection 🦴🦴
 
👉Delft University (+Hensoldt Optronics) introduces OSSA, a novel unsupervised domain adaptation method for object detection that utilizes a single, unlabeled target image to approximate the target domain style. A step towards the end of extensive data collection. Source Code released💙
 
𝐇𝐢𝐠𝐡𝐥𝐢𝐠𝐡𝐭𝐬:  
✅SOTA unsupervised one-shot style adaptation  
✅Single image to capture the style of a dataset  
✅Significantly reducing need for extensive data  
✅Addressing style in diverse contexts (weather)  
✅Synthetic-to-real / visual-to-thermal infrared adaptation
