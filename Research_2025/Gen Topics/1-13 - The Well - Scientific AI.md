Could this be the ImageNet moment for scientific AI?
 
Today, as part of a large international collaboration, we're releasing two massive datasets that span dozens of fields - from bacterial growth to supernova!
 
We want this to enable multi-disciplinary foundation model research.
 
You might ask: why would such diverse training data help AI? Well, as we've seen over the past few years, breadth of training can lead to stronger performance. We want AI to exploit common phenomena across sciences – take for example, waves, which appear in many systems!
 
The first dataset, "The Well", contains curated simulations from 16 scientific domains, each capturing fundamental equations that appear throughout nature:
 
- Fluid dynamics & turbulence  
- Supernova explosions  
- Biological pattern formation  
- Acoustic wave propagation  
- Magnetohydrodynamics
 
All validated and/or generated by domain experts.
 
The second dataset, "Multimodal Universe", brings together astronomical data from major observatories and surveys:
 
- Hundreds of millions of observations  
- Multiple modalities, object types, wavelengths  
- Data from JWST, HST, Gaia, and several other major surveys
 
All unified in a single, ML-ready format.
 
For ML researchers, this is:
 
- 115TB of validated, well-understood scientific data  
- Clean train/test splits  
- Benchmark tasks ready  
- Available now on HuggingFace!
 
We are thankful to have both of these papers accepted to NeurIPS 2024, in the datasets & benchmarks track. Our code is open-sourced here, with easy-to-use APIs:

I'm excited about this both for ML research, and for the problems it will enable us to solve in science!
 
This was a collaboration with a 'dream team' of researchers around the world, including:
