We’ve developed XMoP, a novel neural policy that solves motion planning problems for unseen robotic manipulators with zero-shot generalization. For the first time, we’ve demonstrated that behavior cloning policies in configuration space (C-space) can be transferred to unseen manipulators without embodiment bias.
 
Key highlights:  
⚡ Zero-shot C-space generalization to new robotic manipulators without retraining, with easy addition of robots using URDF files.  
⚡ Average 70% planning success rate across 7 commercial manipulators with a single pre-trained checkpoint trained on fully synthetic data.  
⚡Sim2Real generalization for real-world planning tasks in unseen environments using only visual inputs.
 
We’re excited to see how this work will open new doors in the field of motion planning, robot learning, and more optimistically, robot foundation models that learn expressive whole-body behaviors independent of the embodiment. You can check out our paper, code, and ROS package for more details.
