Thrilled to announce that our work, "SplArt," has been accepted to ICCV 2025!
 
SplArt leverages 3D Gaussian Splatting to reconstruct articulated objects like cabinets or laptops from just a few RGB images, enabling real-time photorealistic renderings.
 
Beyong state-of-the-art performance, SplArt boasts its real-world practicality, operating on images from a simple handheld camera without needing 3D supervision or annotations.
