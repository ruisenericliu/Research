A robot hand grasp over 500 totally new objects without fail? Zero-shot, single-view & super reliable ⬇️ + Paper
 
Grasping random objects is hard for robots, especially when shapes, weights, and materials vary.
 
RobustDexGrasp solves this with a smart new way of seeing and controlling the hand, leading to near-perfect grasping…
 
even in noisy or cluttered scenes.
 
What makes it special  
✅ Grabs 500+ unseen objects with 94.6% success using only single-view input  
✅ Learns local shapes, not full geometry, for better generalization  
✅ Trained with just 35 objects in sim but works in the real world with hundreds more  
✅ Adapts to noise, unexpected forces, and even plays chess with VLM planning
 
It shows that smart sensing and adaptive control can take dexterous grasping to the next level.
