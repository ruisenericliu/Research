Unitree G1 Humanoid Price from $16K!
 
G1 has 23-43 joints and offers extra large joint angle limits  
Notably, it has really usable 3 fingered hands in addition to anthromoporphic hands with Force control (in some variants).
 
The demo is impressive in so many aspects as it is, but points of note  
1. the robot is smaller than a human  
2. light weight that a human could lift! and even folds into a small volume!  
3. hands doing both high force and high precision tasks.
 
Humanoids at this price point speed up the development from academic labs, as well as add a sense of urgency among other Humanoid companies to improve the pricing of their hardware platforms.  
This is so exciting!
