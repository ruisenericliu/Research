Figure can now walk naturally like a human.
 
We are excited to introduce our end-to-end neural network, trained with reinforcement learning (RL), for humanoid locomotion.
 
Our robot learns to walk naturally similar to a human via a high fidelity physics simulator. We simulate years of data in only a few hours.
 
By combining domain randomization in simulation with high-frequency torque feedback on the robot, policies trained in sim transfer zero-shot to real hardware without additional tuning.
 
Today, we're sharing a detailed write-up on how we are using Reinforcement Learning, training in simulation, and zero-shot transfer to our robot fleet. Learn more here: [https://lnkd.in/gWd7k_na](https://lnkd.in/gWd7k_na)
