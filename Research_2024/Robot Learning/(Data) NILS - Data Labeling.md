Tired of labeling your robot data? Excited to present NILS, a novel approach that leverages foundation models to not only segments video sequences into tasks, but also generates semantically meaningful natural language annotations of varying levels of granularity! By leveraging VLMs we effectively import Internet-scale knowledge into existing offline datasets. We use NILS to label over 420 hours of robot data spanning multiple datasets and robot embodiments and show that language conditioned policies trained on our labels either match or outperform human labels!  
We will present this work at the Conference on Robot Learning [hashtag#corl2024](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/hashtag/?keywords=corl2024&highlightedUpdateUrns=urn%3Ali%3Aactivity%3A7257451205147205633) in Munich next week.
