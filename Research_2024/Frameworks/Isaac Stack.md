Leading robotic developers from 1X, Agility Robotics, The AI Institute, Boston Dynamics, Fourier, Galbot, [LimX Dynamics](https://medium.com/@limxdynamics/limx-dynamics-to-advance-general-purpose-robotics-development-with-nvidia-isaac-platform-7aabc2560a65), RobotEra, Sanctuary AI, and UBTECH are integrating Isaac Lab to develop their next-generation robots and humanoids. Many of these companies are already leveraging Isaac Sim to test their robots in realistic environments and to generate synthetic data for model training.

Forget 2D and 3D LiDARs for factories.  
NVIDIA Isaac Perceptor uses cameras for 3D perception, detecting hazards invisible to 2D lidar and offers a cost-effective alternative to expensive 3D lidars, improving robot-human safety.
 
On top of that, it collects all the valuable data for Virtual Factory.
 
Virtual factories are digital twins on steroids 💪  
While there is never-ending discussion about what the digital twin is and what it is not, the definition of Virtual Factory can be very clear.
 
It is a physically accurate 3D representation of a real factory. It allows manufacturers to model, simulate, analyze and optimize their production processes, resources and operations without the need for a physical prototype or pilot plant.
 
I really smell future being cooked here by developers on [NVIDIA Omniverse](https://www.linkedin.com/company/nvidia-omniverse/)
