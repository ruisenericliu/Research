An open-source project called Perplexica replicates the $8B startup Perplexity so developers can easily launch AI-powered search tools. The icing on the cake: commercial use is permitted!
 
Perplexica is an open-source AI-powered search tool that dives deep into the internet to find precise answers. Perplexica not only searches the web but also understands your questions, delivering clear answers with cited sources.
 
It supports local models such as Llama3 and Mixtral for faster and cheaper inference and has six specialized modes tailored to answer specific types of questions:
 
(1) All Mode - searches the entire web for the best results
 
(2) Writing Assistant Mode - assists with writing tasks without web searches
 
(3) Academic Search Mode - ideal for finding articles and papers for academic research
 
(4) YouTube Search Mode - finds YouTube videos based on search queries
 
(5) Wolfram Alpha Search Mode - uses Wolfram Alpha for calculations and data analysis
 
(6) Reddit Search Mode - searches Reddit for discussions and opinions
 
Unlike other tools that use outdated data, Perplexica provides the latest information using a metasearch engine called SearxNG.
