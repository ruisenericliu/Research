🔹 In collaboration with [Carnegie Mellon University](https://www.linkedin.com/company/carnegie-mellon-university/) and [San Diego State University](https://www.linkedin.com/company/san-diego-state-university/)  
🔹 Abridged Abstract: The paper introduces the Multi-Head Gaussian Adaptive Attention Mechanism (GAAM) and the Gaussian Adaptive Transformer (GAT) for enhancing contextual representations across multiple modalities such as speech, text, and vision. GAAM incorporates learnable mean and variance parameters into its attention mechanism, demonstrating significant improvements in model performance.

Key contributions include:  
➡️ Introduction of the GAAM and GAT, providing a fully learnable probabilistic attention framework with learnable mean and variance parameters, significantly enhancing the model's capacity for dynamic recalibration of feature importance.  
➡️ Introduction of the Importance Factor (IF) as a new learning-based metric to enhance model explainability in GAAM-based methods, quantitatively evaluating feature significance and enhancing interpretability.  
➡️ Validation of the effectiveness of GAAM within GAT across multiple modalities, demonstrating superiority in handling highly non-stationary data over conventional dot-product attention and earlier Gaussian-based attention mechanisms.  
➡️ Demonstration of the integration of GAAM with Grouped Query Attention, showing compatibility with existing PTM models and improving performance with a marginal increase in learnable parameters..
