Advances in artificial intelligence have enabled breakthroughs in several fields, including computer vision and natural language processing in both academia and industry. In this fireside conversation, NVIDIA’s senior director of robotics research, Dieter Fox, will be joined by Marc Raibert, the executive director of The AI Institute, to discuss how artificial intelligence has impacted robotics, from the traditional controls era to today.
   

Marc Raibert - Mission of BDAII  
BD going commercial on the hardware; physicality of the robot  
BD was doing very little on artificial intelligence  
Wants to create the Bell labs of Robotics AI - 200 people at BDAII
 
Q: Forward Interests:  
Generative AI/ Reinforcement Learning  
Non of the learning models are performing at the level of precision of quality as hand-crafted solutions
 
Q: Data Generation?  
Hardware reliable enough to do more than 1 experiment a day is rough  
No gantries, blah blah
 
RTX - Data sharing  
Brief mention of Covariant
 
Q: Overfit on specific data? What about sim?  
Better to have a person with real robot experience go back to design the simulation
 
Q: Sim2real transfer  
The new wave of sims and foundation models don't think about force/torques/contacts  
Need to ground language in the physicality of the world
 
Q: What about the gap between foundational models on the internet and real world contact?  
Don't know. I'm now like a "venture capitalist"  
LLM/RL/MPC - think there will be cross pollination
 
For manipulation, still unsolved frontier - it's been 50 years
 
I just don't think static clasp is the path to dexterity  
Physics based approach? Foundational models?
 
For locomotion:  
Static motion wasn't going to flow - that's what BD's fundamental breakthrough  
Need a similar breakthrough for manipulation
 
Glad that humanoids are being a thing with ROI in factories  
Most of them have a lot of fingers
 
Q: Talk about sensors in addition to DOF  
Really hard to put sensors on end effectors
 
Matt Mason's sensor less test could do without sensing  
Optimistic about machine learning for manipulation task
 
Q: But how are you going to do ML for dexterous tasks? Handcrafted, RL, LfD from videos?  
It's better to have a less than expert copy a task  
Sim will help; Request to NVDIA to work on the physics of contact (LOL)
 
Q: Ugh deformables are hard - let's talk about assert generation in physics simulators. GenAI?  
Sure
 
Q: Who will pay for this shit?  
BD did a good job with spot - 1500 out in the world  
Disaster scenarios; decent at making digital twins for manufacturing  
Maybe car companies?  
Tesla - itself  
Figure - BMW  
BD - Hyundai(?)  
Not really sure if there is a strict cost effective avenue - still a moonshot of awesomeness
 
Q: Maybe Industrial Automation is still the way - Dieter Fox  
There is no task that is phenomenal for a robot; people should be appreciated more
 
Commentary: bio-brains are still so much smarter and efficient
 
Commentary: Communication with robots is kind of solved
 
Q: What do you think of GPT/SORA - how has it changed the mission of the AI Institute?  
Idk dude, we might be riding/drowning the genAI wave  
Idk, excited about the future though
   

Now time for questions from the audience
 
Q: Who do you think has the lead in genAI + robotics? Nationally?  
U.S. still the center of computing  
There are 100 companies making humanoids in China now  
Reminder: physical hardware is just as important as the software
   

Q: Robot harm?  
Cruise car withdrawing from SF troubles Marc;  
Marc: this is politics; let's focus on the cognitive function of robot
 
Q: What about industrial robots?  
Marc: I don't really know about industrial robots anymore  
Shoutout: Intrinsic, Realtime, Mujin (Moojin?) - these dudes trying to make industrial robots more modern - stop this repetitive shit.
 
Dieter: well, a new generation of AI powered robots is here
 
Q: What do you think of Foundational models for robotics?  
Marc: we talked about this; planning will be smarter; vision processing, navigation ++  
In the future, we won't need a digital twin for robots  
Other work in tactile sensing and etc matter more for traditional methods
 
Dieter: Low level control still runs at a far higher clock than foundational models
 
Q: What's the biggest mistake you made?  
In the early years, I didn't have enough confidence to do the things I wanted to  
The way to do the things we really want to do is to figure out what's "really on track" to you  
BD was started as a sim company, until we decided to go back on track  
I will be proven wrong - being open to ideas is a really good thing to do
