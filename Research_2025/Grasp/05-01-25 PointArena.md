🚀 Thrilled to share our latest work: PointArena: Probing Multimodal Grounding Through Language-Guided Pointing.
 
Pointing is one of the most intuitive ways humans ground language in visual context—yet it's often overlooked in multimodal evaluation. PointArena is the first unified benchmark that systematically evaluates how well multimodal models can point based on language.
 
🔍 What’s in PointArena?  
Point-Bench: 982 language-image pairs across 5 reasoning types—spatial, affordance, counting, steerability, and abstract reasoning.
 
Point-Battle: A live, crowd-sourced arena with 4,500+ human votes comparing model predictions head-to-head.
 
Point-Act: A real-world robot manipulation setup to test if models can turn pointing into action.
 
🎯 Key Findings  
Open models like Molmo-72B outperform proprietary giants like GPT-4o and Gemini.
 
Pointing-specific supervision yields major performance gains.
 
Static benchmark accuracy strongly correlates with human preference and real-world success.
 
Bigger ≠ better — model size alone has limited impact on pointing accuracy.
 
🧠 Why it matters  
Pointing isn't just a benchmark task—it’s fundamental for robotics, assistive tech, and spatially grounded AI.
 
PointArena provides a scalable, rigorous way to evaluate these capabilities.
 
👏 Big thanks to our incredible team at UW and AI2 for making this possible!
