The sparse autoencoder does not capture all the behavior of the original model. Currently, passing GPT-4’s activations through the sparse autoencoder results in a performance equivalent to a model trained with roughly 10x less compute

o fully map the concepts in frontier LLMs, we may need to scale to billions or trillions of features, which would be challenging even with our improved scaling techniques
