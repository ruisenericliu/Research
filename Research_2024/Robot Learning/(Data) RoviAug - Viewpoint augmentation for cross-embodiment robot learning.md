➡️Paper Title: RoVi-Aug: Robot and Viewpoint Augmentation for Cross-Embodiment Robot Learning
 
🌟Few pointers from the paper
 
🎯Scaling up robot learning requires large and diverse datasets, and how to efficiently reuse collected data and transfer policies to new embodiments remains an open question.
 
🎯Emerging research such as the Open-X Embodiment (OXE) project has shown promise in leveraging skills by combining datasets including different robots.
 
🎯However, imbalances in the distribution of robot types and camera angles in many datasets make policies prone to overfit. To mitigate this issue, Authors of this paper proposed “RoVi-Aug”, which leverages state-of-the-art image-to-image generative models to augment robot data by synthesizing demonstrations with different robots and camera views.
 
🎯Through extensive physical experiments, they showed that, by training on robot- and viewpoint-augmented data, RoVi-Aug can zero-shot deploy on an unseen robot with significantly different camera angles.
 
🎯Compared to test-time adaptation algorithms such as Mirage, RoVi-Aug requires no extra processing at test time, does not assume known camera angles, and allows policy fine-tuning.
 
🎯Moreover, by co-training on both the original and augmented robot datasets, RoVi-Aug can learn multi-robot and multi-task policies, enabling more efficient transfer between robots and skills and improving success rates by up to 30%.
