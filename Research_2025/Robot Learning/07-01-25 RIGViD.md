Is **VideoGen** starting to become good enough for robotic manipulation?
 
🤖 Check out our recent work, RIGVid — Robots Imitating Generated Videos — where we use AI-generated videos as intermediate representations and 6-DoF motion retargeting to guide robots in diverse manipulation tasks: pouring, wiping, mixing, and more.

Key takeaways:  
- VideoGen starts to become good enough for robotics  
- As the field progresses, we are expecting much better results in the coming years  
- Depending on whether video prediction models take actions or not (VideoGen vs Action-Conditioned Video Prediction), there are different ways to use them.  
- Controllability & steerability are still issues
 
In the paper, we explore:  
– How do different video generation models compare for robotic imitation?  
– Can generated videos replace real videos for imitation?  
– What causes failure of imitation given high-quality videos?  
– How does imitating from video compare with other representations (e.g., keypoint constraints like ReKep)?
 
🎥 Watch the video for (1) AI-generated inputs, (2) robot executions, and (3) the 3D intermediate representation bridging the embodiment gap.
