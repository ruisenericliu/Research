Universal Robots released today it's AI accelerator at ROScon. it's the NVIDIA Isaac ROS stack integrated with their polyscope X Standard UR software, running on Jetson. This is for developers, not end users.
 
They hope that this will accelerate AI app development on their robots, creating an AI software platform next to their massive hardware platform they created in the last 15 years.
 
It seems that ROS 2 and NVIDIA are unstoppable and a new force in robotics is awakening.
 
Movie shows the app we could test today for ourselves at the Teradyne UR headquarters in Odense.
 
The idea behind it was given in an insightful (really) presentation by Anders Billesø Beck about AI in robotics, they are down to earth, in it for the long run. They are opening up a lot.
