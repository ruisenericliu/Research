🔍 Introducing RoboSpatial!  
We developed a data pipeline that automatically annotates real 3D indoor/tabletop scenes with spatial questions tailored to robotics:  
✅ 1M images  
✅ 5k 3D scans  
✅ 3M+ spatial QAs  
✅ Robotics-relevant spatial tasks.  
✅ Multiple reference frames (ego, object, world)  
👉 To support evaluation, we also introduce RoboSpatial-Home — a manually annotated benchmark focused on spatial reasoning in realistic home settings.
 
📈 Does it work?  
Yes — training on RoboSpatial improves spatial reasoning across:  
- Spatial benchmarks (RoboSpatial-Home, BLINK, SpatialBench)  
- Real-world robot manipulation tasks  
- Domain transfer (e.g., indoor ↔ tabletop)  
It helps build stronger spatial priors for foundation models that control physical agents.
 
🧩 What’s next?  
We see RoboSpatial as a stepping stone toward:  
- General-purpose robot foundation models (e.g., Google DeepMind Gemini-ER, NVIDIA GR00T, Physical Intelligence Hi Robot, Figure Helix)  
- Modular robotic systems  
- AR/VR applications with spatial grounding  
But spatial understanding is hard — our results show that even with scale, we still need better model architectures and learning paradigms to bridge the gap between VLMs and embodied agents.
