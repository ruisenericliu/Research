Detecting failures is critical to enabling trustworthy policy deployment in safety-critical settings. However, how do we detect policy failures during a rollout without a priori knowledge of potential failures?
 
We introduce FAIL-Detect🚨, which requires no additional failure data and produces failure detectors that can distinguish successful versus failed rollouts in real time.
 
FAIL-Detect is a modular two-stage framework that (1) distills policy inputs and outputs into meaningful scalar signals and (2) constructs decision thresholds by leveraging conformal prediction bands. We further propose a novel flow-based density estimator to maximize the failure detection capability.
 
FAIL-Detect is task-agnostic and policy-agnostic to be highly flexible. Real-time detections are indicated with red borders below.
