🚀 Just wrapped up an amazing week sharing my work on the SO-ARM100 robot arm on the NVIDIA Omniverse livestream — and a new tutorial is now live!
 
Last week, I had the incredible opportunity to present on the official NVIDIA Omniverse Livestream, where I walked through how to train the SO-ARM100 in Isaac Lab, starting from a URDF file. Huge thanks again to Michael Gussert, Edmar Mendizabal, and Eric Bowman for the invitation and for sharing their insights live with the community. 🙌
 
🎥 I’ve just published a condensed tutorial that builds on that session — perfect for those who want a more focused walkthrough. You’ll learn:
 
• How to import your robot from URDF into Isaac Sim  
• The difference between force and acceleration drive types  
• How stiffness and damping are calculated in Isaac Sim  
• How to set joint limits and tune physics settings  
• Why the Articulation Root matters for ROS and RL
 
And for those curious about URDF itself or just getting started with simulation, I highly recommend the Articulated Robotics channel — one of the best learning resources out there. - Thanks Josh Newans 📚
 
More tutorials are coming soon — especially on ROS integration and Isaac Lab training for the SO-ARM100. I'm proud to work alongside some incredibly talented community members like Kabilan Kb, who also contribute powerful tutorials and content to help others get started. 🔧💡
