Most learning-based robot policies fail on hardware. They send slow or choppy commands.  
📍That’s where CRISP comes in:
 
CRISP is a set of compliant ROS2 controllers that make diffusion and VLA models run smoothly on real robots.
 
✅ Torque-based Cartesian and joint-space controllers, no MoveIt needed  
✅ Python interface and Gymnasium wrapper for deployment and data collection  
✅ Validated on Franka FR3, works with any effort-interface manipulator
 
CRISP lowers the barrier from simulation to deployment.
 
Thank you for sharing, Angela Schoellig, who am I still trying to get on my podcast 😝
