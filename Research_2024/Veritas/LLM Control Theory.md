Excited to share our recent work developing LLM Control Theory!
 
Turns out, a lot of fascinating questions emerge when you start treating LLMs as discrete dynamical systems. I've been developing this direction with [Cameron Witkowski](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ACoAACMW2qwBw7uQHwe-Nzga0EI7nmBLcQk5i1I) (fellow EngSci 2t2, current ECE Masters Student at Utoronto), Dr. [Shi-Zhuo Looi](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ACoAAETZkU4B2h_pKEjksQCjvQ-OJsxuW5867yg) (Math Postdoc [Caltech](https://www.linkedin.com/company/california-institute-of-technology/)), and my supervisor Prof. Matt Thomson.
 
From experiments on reachable model outputs to theorems about self-attention controllability, we're starting to uncover a new perspective on what's really going on inside these models.
 
My favorite part is that the control-theoretic formulation naturally generates so many concrete problems to sink our teeth into. Suddenly, "prompt engineering" becomes a space of rigorous, well-defined questions to solve!
 
Check out the two-minute overview video below from our seminar at the Caltech Math department graciously hosted by Dr. Juan Pablo Vigneaux Ariztia. Watch the full talk here: [https://lnkd.in/gQg-dsDP](https://lnkd.in/gQg-dsDP)
 
Stay tuned for updates on our preprint: [https://lnkd.in/gBcbv9TT](https://lnkd.in/gBcbv9TT)

Also, shoutout to Profs. Stark Draper (Utoronto ECE367: Matrix Algebra & Optimization), Lacra Pavel (Utoronto ECE356: Linear Systems and Control), Margaret Chapman (Utoronto ECE557: Linear Control Theory), and Michelle Effros (Caltech Ma126a: Information Theory) for their amazing lectures. Turns out that stuff comes in handy for more than just problem sets!
 
Super grateful for the support we've received on this project so far.
 
Anyway, back to the GPU cluster. Remember, it's just a function ;)
