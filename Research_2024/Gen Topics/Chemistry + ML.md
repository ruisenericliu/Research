Four years ago, I began a journey to learn how advances in machine learning and chemistry could help mitigate climate change. For me, getting up to speed in this new area was quite a challenge, and wouldn’t have been possible without so many great collaborators in chemistry.
 
To help others get up to speed, we’re releasing a new video series to make chemistry+ML more accessible to the AI/ML community. We hope this basic introduction will enable more ML researchers explore this impactful area! No chemistry background needed!
 
The first two videos are out, with 3 more on the way:  
Episode 1: Why model atoms? [https://lnkd.in/gg-UAudK](https://lnkd.in/gg-UAudK)  
Episode 2: How do we model atoms? [https://lnkd.in/gBW7264S](https://lnkd.in/gBW7264S)  
Episode 3: How do we model catalysts?  
Episode 4: How do we use ML to model atoms?  
Episode 5: What are spherical harmonics?
 
Let us know if there are any other topics you'd like covered!
