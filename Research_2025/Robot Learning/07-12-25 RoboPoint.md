Robopoint:
 
VLMs and VLAs with mobile manipulation getting really interesting and useful.
 
Deployed a RoboPoint VLM on an Orin AGX with a 13B Vicuna LLM. Asked it to predict action points for generic manipulation and arranging instructions with natural language such as:
 
- Find a free space in the shelf  
- Pick the rightmost object  
- Locate several vacant points in the bin
 
then solved the motion planning and executed it on the robot.
