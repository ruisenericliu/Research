Introducing ✨Posed DROID✨, results of our efforts at automatic post-hoc calibration of a large-scale robotics manipulation dataset.
 
We provide:  
🤖 ~36k calibrated episodes with good quality extrinsic calibration  
🦾 ~24k calibrated multi-view episodes with good-quality multi-view camera calibration  
✅ Quality Assessment Metrics for all provided camera poses
 
To achieve this, we utilize:  
1️⃣ Auto-SAM based filtering (Camera-to-Base Calibration)  
2️⃣ Tuned CtRNet-X for bringing in additional cams (Camera-to-Base Calibration)  
3️⃣ Pretrained DUST3R with depth-based pose optimization (Camera-to-Camera Calibration)

This was a fun collaboration with Vitor Guizilini, Alexander Khazatsky and Karl Pertsch
 
Shoutout to the authors of the wonderful papers i.e. CtRNet-X, DUSt3R, Segment Anything, CLIP and Pytorch3D and for open-sourcing their codebase to advance science and make this effort happen! Please check these works out if you haven’t already!
