Our original embodied CoT paper showed that VLAs benefit from grounded reasoning before acting, at the cost of inference speed. In this work led by William Chen we uncover why ECoT works better and propose new recipes that retain generalization while running 3x faster at test time!  
Excited to see that ECoT has been successfully applied in many works (Physical Intelligence, Gemini Robotics, Waymo EMMA...)
