Excited to introduce NORA (Neural Orchestrator for Robotic Autonomy) — a Vision-Language-Action (VLA) model tailored for embodied tasks. NORA is a small (~3B parameter) VLA model built on the Qwen2.5-VL backbone and trained on OXE. We developed multiple versions of NORA to evaluate which configurations perform best across different robot control frequencies, from low to high.
 
NORA achieves state-of-the-art performance on several real-world and simulated tasks.
 
Kudos to the entire team Chia Yu Hung Sun Qi, Peng Fei Hong U-Xuan Tan Navonil Mazumder. It was not possible without the huge support from the Lambda labs.
