CRISP: Object Pose and Shape Estimation with Test-Time Adaptation
 
We propose a category-agnostic approach for object pose and shape estimation, based on a pre-trained vision transformer (ViT) backbone with a dense prediction transformer and feature-wise linear modulation (FiLM) condition.
 
We show how to quickly correct the prediction at test time using sensor data (what we call the “corrector”).
 
Finally, we show that the resulting pipeline can be trained in a self-supervised manner, which is useful for domain adaptation.
 
We demonstrate CRISP across multiple datasets, from common objects (YCBV, NOCS) to satellites (SPE3R dataset).
