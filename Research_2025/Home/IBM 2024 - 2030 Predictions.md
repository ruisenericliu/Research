At IBM we created an AI Roadmap for the next few years. Folks... check what is coming:
 
𝟮𝟬𝟮𝟰: 𝗕𝘂𝗶𝗹𝗱 𝗠𝗼𝗱𝘂𝗹𝗮𝗿 𝗮𝗻𝗱 𝗠𝘂𝗹𝘁𝗶𝗺𝗼𝗱𝗮𝗹 𝗧𝗿𝗮𝗻𝘀𝗳𝗼𝗿𝗺𝗲𝗿𝘀 𝗳𝗼𝗿 𝗡𝗲𝘄 𝗘𝗻𝘁𝗲𝗿𝗽𝗿𝗶𝘀𝗲 𝗔𝗽𝗽𝗹𝗶𝗰𝗮𝘁𝗶𝗼𝗻𝘀
 
In 2024, we will deploy enterprise AI assistants and applications using advanced transformers and developer-friendly frameworks. This will facilitate richer contextual information processing and enhance control and monitoring of generative AI.
 
𝟮𝟬𝟮𝟱: 𝗔𝗹𝘁𝗲𝗿 𝘁𝗵𝗲 𝗦𝗰𝗮𝗹𝗶𝗻𝗴 𝗼𝗳 𝗚𝗲𝗻𝗲𝗿𝗮𝘁𝗶𝘃𝗲 𝗔𝗜 𝘄𝗶𝘁𝗵 𝗡𝗲𝘂𝗿𝗮𝗹 𝗔𝗿𝗰𝗵𝗶𝘁𝗲𝗰𝘁𝘂𝗿𝗲𝘀 𝗕𝗲𝘆𝗼𝗻𝗱 𝗧𝗿𝗮𝗻𝘀𝗳𝗼𝗿𝗺𝗲𝗿𝘀
 
In 2025, we will leverage a diverse selection of neural architectures, including and beyond transformers, co-optimized with purpose-built AI accelerators. This approach will fundamentally alter how we scale generative AI.
 
𝟮𝟬𝟮𝟲: 𝗕𝗿𝗶𝗻𝗴 𝗥𝗼𝗯𝘂𝘀𝘁, 𝗦𝘁𝗿𝗮𝘁𝗲𝗴𝗶𝗰 𝗥𝗲𝗮𝘀𝗼𝗻𝗶𝗻𝗴 𝗮𝗻𝗱 𝗖𝗼𝗺𝗺𝗼𝗻𝘀𝗲𝗻𝘀𝗲 𝗞𝗻𝗼𝘄𝗹𝗲𝗱𝗴𝗲 𝘁𝗼 𝗔𝗜
 
In 2026, our focus will be on supporting faster learning and the ability to provide explanations through improved introspection, retrospection, and various forms of reasoning. This will bring more robust and strategic reasoning capabilities to AI.
 
𝟮𝟬𝟮𝟴: 𝗗𝗲𝘃𝗲𝗹𝗼𝗽 𝗕𝗿𝗼𝗮𝗱𝗹𝘆 𝗜𝗻𝘁𝗲𝗹𝗹𝗶𝗴𝗲𝗻𝘁 𝗔𝗴𝗲𝗻𝘁𝘀 𝗧𝗵𝗮𝘁 𝗟𝗲𝗮𝗿𝗻 𝗔𝘂𝘁𝗼𝗻𝗼𝗺𝗼𝘂𝘀𝗹𝘆
 
By 2028, we will build autonomous AI that learns reliably and efficiently from its environment, adapting to previously unseen situations through broad generalizations. These AI systems will start exhibiting aspects of biological intelligence.
 
𝟮𝟬𝟯𝟬+: 𝗕𝘂𝗶𝗹𝗱 𝗔𝗱𝗮𝗽𝘁𝗮𝗯𝗹𝗲 𝗮𝗻𝗱 𝗚𝗲𝗻𝗲𝗿𝗮𝗹𝗶𝘀𝘁 𝗔𝗜 𝗳𝗼𝗿 𝗘𝗳𝗳𝗲𝗰𝘁𝗶𝘃𝗲 𝗛𝘂𝗺𝗮𝗻-𝗠𝗮𝗰𝗵𝗶𝗻𝗲 𝗖𝗼𝗹𝗹𝗮𝗯𝗼𝗿𝗮𝘁𝗶𝗼𝗻
 
Beyond 2030, we aim to create adaptable and generalist AI that can collaborate effectively with humans. These AI models will be composed of modules with different cognitive abilities—such as perception, memory, emotion, reasoning, and action—allowing them to exhibit behavioral norms for social interactions and mutual theory of mind.
 
Get ready; we are just getting started!
