🥳 This is such a solid repo that covers all parts of the AI agent production pipeline. It dropped just a week ago and already has 6k stars ⭐ !
 
Nir Diamant has done it again! Thanks for putting this together. It’s a one-stop resource for anyone building real-world agents for production use-cases.
 
It includes tutorials, notebooks, and examples for every layer :  
⛳ Orchestration Design: Multi-tool, memory-aware workflows and agent-to-agent messaging  
⛳Tool Integration: Connect agents to databases, web data, and external APIs  
⛳Observability: Add tracing, monitoring, and debugging hooks  
⛳ Deployment: Ship to containers, GPU clusters, or on-prem servers  
⛳ Memory: Implement short- and long-term memory with semantic search  
⛳ UI & Frontend: Build chat or dashboard front-ends  
⛳ A gent Frameworks: Create stateful graphs, expose agents as REST endpoints, and package reusable tools  
⛳Model Customization: Fine-tune LLMs for domain-specific behavior  
⛳Multi-agent Coordination: Enable message passing and shared planning  
⛳Security: Add real-time guardrails and injection protection  
⛳Evaluation: Automate behavioral testing and metric tracking
 
Even if you don’t use the code/notebooks as is, it gives you a clear sense of the key components involved in building a production pipeline and how you might approach each of them!
