Agent2Agent:  
• Agentic-first: No shared memory/tools needed.  
• Standards-compliant: HTTP, JSON-RPC, SSE.  
• Secure by default.  
• Handles short and long tasks.  
• Modality-agnostic – from video streaming to text.

Breaking news: "Researchers recreated DeepSeek's core technology for just $30!" :D
 
"The team successfully replicated DeepSeek R1-Zero’s reinforcement learning (RL) capabilities using a compact language model with just 3 billion parameters. Despite its smaller scale, the model demonstrated self-verification and search capabilities, allowing it to refine its own responses iteratively—key features of DeepSeek’s advanced AI."
 
TinyZero: A Minimalist Reinforcement Learning Framework for $30
 
"The recipe: [They] follow DeepSeek R1-Zero alg -- Given a base LM, prompts and ground-truth reward, [they] run RL. [They then] apply it to CountDown: a game where players combine numbers with basic arithmetic to reach a target number...
 
and it just works!
 
"The model starts from dummy outputs but gradually develop tactics such as revision and search. "
 
Of course, this is for a very restricted domain on a very specific reasoning problem. But I think this opens the door to develop reasoning models for specific business / industry tasks with the right data sets."

[Ai2 launches Paper Finder](https://link.alphasignal.ai/ctpmMU), an LLM-powered tool for finding niche research papers with summaries.
   

In contrast, QwQ-32B skipped preliminary fine-tuning and applied RL in two stages, first optimizing for correct responses and then for readability.
