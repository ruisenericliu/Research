Finally I can talk about it:  
This is work from my sabbatical at Google Deepmind. We developed a new method that allows Gemini (LLMs) to coach and train a robot. We used it to train a table tennis robot and teach it different skills. Our approach is called SAS Prompt, which stands for Summarize, Analyze, Synthesize. We will present it at ICRA 2025 in Atlanta in a couple of weeks!
