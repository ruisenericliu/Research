**skrl** is an open-source modular library for Reinforcement Learning written in Python (using PyTorch) and designed with a focus on readability, simplicity, and transparency of algorithm implementation. In addition to supporting the OpenAI Gym / Farama Gymnasium and DeepMind and other environment interfaces, it allows loading and configuring [NVIDIA Isaac Gym](https://developer.nvidia.com/isaac-gym/), [NVIDIA Isaac Orbit](https://isaac-orbit.github.io/orbit/index.html) and [NVIDIA Omniverse Isaac Gym](https://docs.omniverse.nvidia.com/app_isaacsim/app_isaacsim/tutorial_gym_isaac_gym.html) environments, enabling agents’ simultaneous training by scopes (subsets of environments among all available environments), which may or may not share resources, in the same run.

The team supporting this effort includes roughly 25 [core members](https://farama.org/team), and roughly 80 non-core contributors, spanning approximately 12 time zones and every background imaginable. Many of our core contributors came from the team behind [OpenAI Gym](https://github.com/openai/gym), which we were the maintainers of for 2 years before it was replaced by our [Gymnasium library](https://gymnasium.farama.org/main/).

Time to migrate your robot simulation!
 
With Gazebo classic's EOL arriving in a few months' time, it's time to explore the various ROS2-compatible simulation possibilities for your projects.
 
There are several alternatives:
 
•  Gazebo Sim: A safe choice for teams used to Gazebo Classic and who want a similar experience (Migration Guide available).
 
•  O3DE: An open-source 3D engine multipurpose that propose a ROS2 integration and is still growing in popularity.
 
•  Isaac Sim: A robotic simulator developed by Nvidia, featuring photo realism and supplied with numerous Nvidia composites.
 
There is also Webots and Mujoco but I haven't tested them yet, so I'd be interested in your feedback.
 
Which simulator will you use for your ROS2 projects?
 
If you would like to share your experiences with these simulators, or with others I haven't mentioned, let a comment 💡
