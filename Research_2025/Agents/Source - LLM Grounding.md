It is fresh news that OpenAI just dropped a new update to its most powerful model to force it better structure output (JSON/Pydantic). But at what cost?
 
A recent study, "Let Me Speak Freely? A Study on the Impact of Format Restrictions on Performance of Large Language Models," offers valuable insights on the effects of forcing LLM to output structured data.
 
- Performance Decline: LLMs show reduced reasoning and domain knowledge when confined to structured formats like JSON or XML.  
- Stricter Constraints: Greater performance drops occur with more stringent format constraints, impacting complex tasks.  
- Flexibility Matters: Allowing LLMs flexibility enhances their capabilities, suggesting the need for adaptable applications.  
- Classification Performances: On the other hand, classification tasks seem to be not degraded at all by JSON mode, in some cases even over performing the vanilla mode.
