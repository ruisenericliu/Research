Agents are extremely unreliable 💀 - Use them only if you have no alternative
 
👉 Don't get me wrong, agentic apps are powerful and unlocks vast fields of previously impossible use cases, but indeed people often try to use them in uses cases where they don't belong. And since agentic systems delegate more autonomy to LLMs, they are also more brittle (because LLMs are dumb), hence overusing them means reducing your system's robustness. ❌
 
[Hugo Bowne-Anderson](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ACoAABZiq_UBeFSpnSI2r4awFPdcEokJRaYRlmY) just wrote an excellent Substack on this subject.  
He advocates to never start with an agent - rather start with a hardcoded workflow and see how far it takes you.
 
Indeed, most of the time, the workflow of your app can be told in advance, it's static (possibly with a few if/else branches) instead of dynamic : this is a situation where you don't need to introduce the brittleness of agent systems.
 
100% agree with his take: you should keep agents for tasks where you have no alternative to their versatility and adaptability!
