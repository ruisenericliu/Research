How can we enabling 𝗵𝘂𝗺𝗮𝗻𝗼𝗶𝗱 𝗿𝗼𝗯𝗼𝘁𝘀🤖 to 𝗮𝘂𝘁𝗼𝗻𝗼𝗺𝗼𝘂𝘀𝗹𝘆 perform hybrid 𝗹𝗼𝗰𝗼-𝗺𝗮𝗻𝗶𝗽𝘂𝗹𝗮𝘁𝗶𝗼𝗻 tasks under human instruction?
 
In this work, we propose 𝙃𝙔𝙋𝙀𝙍𝙢𝙤𝙩𝙞𝙤𝙣, a framework that learns, selects and plans behaviors based on tasks in different scenarios. We combine RL with whole-body optimization to generate motion for CENTAURO robot and create a motion library to store the learned skills.
 
We apply the planning and reasoning features of the large language models (𝗟𝗟𝗠𝘀) to complex loco-manipulation tasks. And by leveraging the interaction of distilled spatial geometry and 2D observation with a visual language model (𝗩𝗟𝗠) to ground knowledge into a robotic morphology selector to choose appropriate actions in single- or dual-arm, legged or wheeled locomotion.
