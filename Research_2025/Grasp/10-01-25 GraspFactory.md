The Robotics Lab at Autodesk Research is excited to announce the first release of GraspFactory, the largest object-centric 6-DoF two-finger grasp dataset to date.
 
GraspFactory contains over 109 million grasps for the Panda and Robotiq 2F85 grippers, covering 14k+ and 33k+ objects in the ABC dataset, respectively. We also train the SE(3)-DiffusionFields model on the Panda subset and present both simulated and experimental results.
 
GraspFactory will be presented at the CoRL 2025 Workshop on Making Sense of Data in Robotics.
