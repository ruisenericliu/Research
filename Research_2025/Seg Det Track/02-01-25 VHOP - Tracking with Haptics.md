Can we robustly track an object’s 6D pose in contact-rich, occluded scenarios? Yes! Our solution, V-HOP, fuses vision and touch through a visuo-haptic transformer for precise, real-time tracking.
 
Unlike vision-only methods 👀 that struggle under occlusion and rapid dynamics, V-HOP leverages a unified haptic representation to enhance robustness and accuracy.
 
Inspired by human multisensory integration, we combine visual cues with tactile and kinesthetic data - represented as a coherent point cloud - for more stable perception.
 
With exceptional generalization across diverse gripper embodiments and sensor types, we show that we can reliably achieve precise manipulation tasks by incorporating our real-time object tracking results into motion plans, even with human perturbations.
