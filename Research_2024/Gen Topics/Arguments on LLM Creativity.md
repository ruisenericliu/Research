It's a common misconception thinking that LLMs are "creative". LLMs perform diffused retrieval given a prompt - they are basically databases, indeed, a new form of database. An agent conceiving a prompt in the first place might have been "creative" if its action was surprising given its situation. Only agents with sufficient functional dynamics (to plan) can be creative by definition, LLMs have no functional dynamics, no agency, therefore LLMs are not creative. Creativity is a strange stepping stone towards something very valuable, it's usually divergent, it might be serendipitous, physically determined, or in very special cases a result of planning / knowledge (see MLST Stanley show).
 
Another interesting feature of LLMs is their surprising degree of factfulness at large scale and responding "as if" they understood the prompt, and "as if" they were "reasoning" (which of course, they are not in the way humans do, mostly). This is because factful things are statistically more likely given internet data and common prompts, and even more so - how OpenAI have curated the training data. Autoregressive pattern matching is a crude form of reasoning. The clever thing is that a lot of what we think is "reasoning" can be formulated as diffused information retrieval, even more so given the generative inductive priors and the uncanny valley effect and anthropomorphism - fooling us into thinking LLMs do more than they actually do.
 
The AUTONOMY GAP is where the magic fades, it quickly becomes obvious LLMs have zero intelligence. There is no intelligence without autonomy, LLMs have no autonomy, therefore LLMs are not intelligent. When you turn an LLM into an agent, it diverges and decoheres exponentially fast. The only way you can prevent this "mode collapse" is by setting extremely tight operating constraints with careful prompting etc. LLMs have zero agency, because agency is about making sense of an exponential number of things you can do with limited computation (LLMs have fixed computation too) (watch MLST recent Wolfram show).￼
