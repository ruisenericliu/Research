Why use [#Docker](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/hashtag/?keywords=docker&highlightedUpdateUrns=urn%3Ali%3Aactivity%3A7149807153384411136) for developing [#robotics](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/hashtag/?keywords=robotics&highlightedUpdateUrns=urn%3Ali%3Aactivity%3A7149807153384411136) software?
 
✔️ Compatibility: Avoid the hassle of managing multiple Ubuntu distributions on a single system by utilizing Docker to run various distributions from a single host.  
✔️ Replicability: Ensure consistent package versions for effortless replication on different computers.  
✔️ Isolation: Keep project-specific configurations separate, enhancing security and enabling parallel simulations with isolated networks.  
✔️ Continuous Integration: Seamlessly integrate Docker into CI pipelines to maintain consistent test environments on remote servers.  
✔️ Fast Deployment: Simplify deployment by encapsulating code and dependencies in lightweight Docker containers, reducing the deployment process to a single image pull.
