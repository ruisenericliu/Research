Additionally, looking towards the future, we’re releasing PARTNR: a benchmark for Planning And Reasoning Tasks in humaN-Robot collaboration. Built on Habitat 3.0, it’s the largest benchmark of its kind to study and evaluate human-robot collaboration in household activities. We hope that standardizing this work will help to accelerate responsible research and innovation in this important field of study.

More on 🎯Sparsh, ☝️Digit 360, 🦾Meta Digit Plexus, and 🤝partnerships w/ [GelSight](https://www.linkedin.com/company/gelsight/) & [Wonik Robotics(](https://www.linkedin.com/company/wonikrobotics/)원익로보틱스) Robotics ⬇
 
- Touch is the most crucial modality for humans to understand and interact with the world. 🎯Sparsh is the first general-purpose touch representation that works across many tasks and many vision-based tactile sensors. Pre-trained with SSL, it outperforms end-to-end methods by an average of over 95% [https://lnkd.in/e598ZhQz](https://lnkd.in/e598ZhQz)
 
- To build richer world models, AI must perceive what’s inaccessible via vision. ☝️Digit 360 is an artificial finger-shaped tactile sensor that digitizes touch with human-level precision. It’s equipped with over 18 unique sensing features including on device AI accelerator, and is capable of measuring forces as small as 1 millinewton [https://digit.ml/](https://digit.ml/)
 
- Dexterity requires coordination across many tactile sensors with actuators that are all on a robot hand. 🦾Meta Digit Plexus is a standardized hardware-software platform to integrate various fingertip and skin tactile sensors onto a single robot hand. It helps encode all data over a single cable for seamless control [https://lnkd.in/evss-D_S](https://lnkd.in/evss-D_S)
 
- We are also partnering with industry leaders to make these advances accessible. 🤝@GelSight will manufacture and distribute Digit 360, targeting wide availability next year. With 🤝@Wonik Robotics we will create the next generation Allegro Hand, an advanced dexterous robot hand, integrated with tactile sensing via Meta Digit Plexus, which is targeted for wide availability next year.
 
- Researchers can apply to call for proposals to gain early access to Digit 360 [https://digit.ml/cfp](https://digit.ml/cfp). Researchers can also stay updated on the next generation Allegro Hand built with Meta via this interest form [https://digit.ml/plexus](https://digit.ml/plexus)
