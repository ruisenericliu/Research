We just released RUKA, a $1300 humanoid hand that is 3D-printable, strong, precise, and fully open sourced!
 
The key technical breakthrough here is that we can control joints and fingertips of the robot **without joint encoders**. Learning from self-supervised data collection is all you need for training the humanoid hand control you see below.
 
This project, which combines hardware design with learning-based controllers was a monumental effort led by Anya Zorin and Irmak Guzey. More links and information about RUKA are below:
