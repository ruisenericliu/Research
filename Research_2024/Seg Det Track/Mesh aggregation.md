From "AI can't do meshes" to NVIDIA's Meshtron in 12 months. The 3D AI space is moving FAST. Perfect breakdown here:
 
→ Early 2023: Shap-E (OpenAI) makes first major attempt at 3D generation, revealing limitations with mesh handling  
→ Summer 2023: 3D Gaussian Splatting brings breakthrough differentiable rendering at real-time frame rates and improved editability  
→ April 2024: InstantMesh introduces direct mesh generation, topping leaderboards  
→ June 2024: MeshAnything solves topology using autoregressive generation (like LLMs)  
→ Mid 2024: Multiple commercial products gain steam - Meshy, Tripo, and Rodin  
→ November 2024: LLamaMesh launches as open source LLM fine-tuned on OBJ files, with Blender integration  
→ December 2024: Trellis introduces new autoregressive approach to mesh generation  
→ December 2024: Meshtron (NVIDIA) arrives as the latest breakthrough in mesh generation technology
 
3D ain't going nowhere; and in 2025 it's gonna get even more epic.
