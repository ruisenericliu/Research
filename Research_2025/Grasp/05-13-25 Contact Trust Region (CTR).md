🚀 Contact Trust Region (CTR): By leveraging the structure of contact models, our recent algorithm can generate roadmap‑style in‑hand manipulation policies in just minutes—on a laptop CPU.
 
While the resulting policies aren’t yet as robust as their RL counterparts, the order‑of‑magnitude efficiency gain is encouraging, and we’re hopeful we can close the robustness gap without spending hundreds of years in simulation.
