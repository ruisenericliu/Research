New state-of-the-art systems like GPT-4, Gemini, and Claude 3 are impressively multimodal: They can generate fluent text in dozens of languages, process audio, and even explain memes.
 
Current AI technology still has significant problems. It cannot reliably deal with facts, perform complex reasoning, or explain its conclusions
   

**Key Takeaways**
 
**1. AI beats humans on some tasks, but not on all.** AI has surpassed human performance on several benchmarks, including some in image classification, visual reasoning, and English understanding. Yet it trails  
behind on more complex tasks like competition-level mathematics, visual commonsense reasoning and planning.
 
**2. Industry continues to dominate frontier AI research. In 2023, industry produced 51 notable** **machine learning models, while academia contributed only 15.** There were also 21 notable models resulting from  
industry-academia collaborations in 2023, a new high.
 
3. Frontier models get way more expensive
 
4. The United States leads China, the EU, and the U.K. as the leading source of top AI models. **In 2023, 61 notable AI models originated from U.S.-based institutions, far outpacing the European** **Union’s 21 and China’s 15.**
 
5. Robust and standardized evaluations for LLM responsibility are seriously lacking.
 
6. Generative AI investment skyrockets. Despite a decline in overall AI private investment last year, funding for generative AI surged, **n****early** **octupling from 2022 to reach $25.2 billion.** Major players in the generative AI space, including OpenAI, Anthropic, Hugging Face, and Inflection, reported substantial  
fundraising rounds
 
7. The data is in: AI makes workers more productive and leads to higher quality work.
 
8. Scientific progress accelerates even further, thanks to AI. In 2022, AI began to advance scientific discovery. 2023, however, saw the launch of even more significant science-related AI applications—from **A****lphaDev****, which makes algorithmic sorting more efficient, to GNoME, which facilitates the process of** **materials discovery**
 
9. The number of AI regulations in the United States sharply increases.
 
10. People across the globe are more cognizant of AI’s potential impact—and more nervous

Neuro symbolic AI:
 
Research from the University of South Carolina and  
the University of Maryland provides a comprehensive  
mapping and taxonomy of various approaches within  
neurosymbolic AI. The research distinguishes between  
approaches that compress structured symbolic  
knowledge for integration with neural network  
structures and those that extract information from  
neural networks to translate them back into structured  
symbolic representations for reasoning. Figure 3.3.6  
illustrates two examples of how this integration could  
be achieved. The researchers hope that neurosymbolic  
AI could mitigate some of the shortcomings of purely  
neural network–based models, such as hallucinations  
or incorrect reasoning, by mimicking human  
cognition—specifically, by enabling models to possess  
an explicit knowledge model of the world.

**Chapter 4 – AI Economy**
 
1. Generative AI investment skyrockets. Despite a decline in overall AI private investment last year, funding for generative AI surged, nearly octupling from 2022 to reach $25.2 billion.  
2. Already a leader, the United States pulls even further ahead in AI private investment.  
**3. Fewer AI jobs in the United States and across the globe. In 2022, AI-related positions made** **up 2.0% of all job postings in America, a figure that decreased to 1.6% in 2023. This decline in AI job listings is** **attributed to fewer postings from leading AI firms and a reduced proportion of tech roles within these companies.**  
4. AI decreases costs and increases revenues. A new McKinsey survey reveals that 42% of surveyed organizations report cost reductions from implementing AI (including generative AI), and 59% report revenue increases. Compared to the previous year, there was a 10 percentage point increase in respondents reporting decreased costs, suggesting AI is driving significant business efficiency gains.  
5. **Total AI private investment declines again,** while the number of newly funded AI companies increases. Global private AI investment has fallen for the second year in a row, though less than the sharp decrease from 2021 t**o 2022. The count of newly funded AI companies spiked to 1,812, up 40.6%** from the previous year  
6. AI organizational adoption ticks up. A 2023 McKinsey report reveals that 55% of organizations now use AI (including generative AI) in at least one business unit or function, up from 50% in 2022 and 20% in 2017.  
7. **China dominates industrial robotics.** Since surpassing Japan in 2013 as the leading installer of industrial robots, China has significantly widened the gap with the nearest competitor nation. In 2013, China’s installations accounted for 20.8% of the global total, a share that rose to **52.4% by 2022.**  
8. Greater diversity in robot installations. In 2017, collaborative robots represented a mere 2.8% of all new industrial robot installations, a figure that climbed to 9.9% by 2022. Similarly, 2022 saw a rise in service robot installations across all application categories, except for medical robotics. This trend indicates not just an overall increase in robot installations but also a growing emphasis on deploying robots for human-facing roles.  
9. The data is in: AI makes workers more productive and leads to higher quality work. In 2023, several studies assessed AI’s impact on labor, suggesting that AI enables workers to complete tasks more quickly and to improve the quality of their output. These studies also demonstrated AI’s potential to bridge the skill gap between low- and high-skilled workers. Still, other studies caution that using AI without proper oversight can lead to diminished performance.  
10. Fortune 500 companies start talking a lot about AI, especially generative AI. In 2023, AI was mentioned in 394 earnings calls (nearly 80% of all Fortune 500 companies), a notable increase from 266 mentions in 2022. Since 2018, mentions of AI in Fortune 500 earnings calls have nearly doubled. The most frequently cited theme, appearing in 19.7% of all earnings calls, was generative AI.
 
**Chapter 5 – Science and Medicine**  
EVEscape, which enhances pandemic prediction, and AlphaMissence, which assists in AI-driven mutation classification.  
AI systems have shown remarkable improvement on the MedQA benchmark, a key test for assessing AI’s clinical knowledge. The  
standout model of 2023, GPT-4 Medprompt, reached an accuracy rate of 90.2%, marking a 22.6 percentage point increase from the highest score in 2022.  
In 2022, the FDA approved 139 AI-related medical devices, a 12.1% increase from 2021. Since 2012, the number of FDA-approved AI-related medicaldevices has increased by more than 45-fold.

**Chapter 6 – Education**  
1. The number of American and Canadian CS bachelor’s graduates continues to rise, new CS master’s graduates stay relatively flat, and PhD graduates modestly grow.  
2. The migration of AI PhDs to industry continues at an accelerating pace. In 2011, roughly equal percentages of new AI PhDs took jobs in industry (40.9%) and academia (41.6%). However, by 2022, a significantly larger proportion (70.7%) joined industry after graduation compared to those entering academia (20.0%)
