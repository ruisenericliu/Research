    - 50 cents per 1M input tokens
- GPT-5.2’s gains in computational efficiency are stark. One year ago, achieving 88 percent on ARC-AGI-1 cost roughly $4,500 per task. GPT-5.2 Pro achieves 90.5 percent at around $12 per task, roughly 390 times less.
- We’re thinking: Technical approaches that aren’t economically feasible today, say running hundreds of reasoning attempts per problem or deploying thousands of reasoning-heavy agents, are on track to become surprisingly affordable within a few years.

It trails proprietary models GPT-5 with thinking enabled (69 points) and Claude Sonnet 4.5 (63 points). Beyond that, it excelled in coding and agentic tasks but proved notably verbose. It consumed 120 million tokens to complete Artificial Analysis evaluations, tied for highest with Grok 4.

- Gemini 2.5 Technical Report:
    - New Gemini 2.5 Technical Report 🧵
    - Gemini 2.5 uses a sparse Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architecture with native multimodality. Its diverse pre-training dataset includes web docs, code, and media, with a knowledge cutoff of January 2025 and improved data quality methods. Table 1 details the full model family capabilities.
    - A key advance in Gemini 2.5 is its "Thinking" capability, allowing models to use more inference-time compute. This boosts reasoning across all domains and significantly improves math and coding abilities. The AIME 2025 score jumped from 29.7% with 2.0 Flash to 72.0% with 2.5 Flash.
    - Gemini 2.5 expands video understanding and can now process up to 3 hours of video content. This is due to improved audio-visual and temporal understanding capabilities, which unlock new interactive applications. 2.5 Pro precisely recalled a 1-second event from a 46-minute video.
    - The model's agentic capabilities were demonstrated in the "Gemini Plays Pokémon" experiment. Gemini Maintained long-horizon goals for over 800 hours and succesfully completed the entire game. A 2nd autonomous run finished in nearly half the time.
    - Gemini 2.5 is the first family trained on TPUv5p benefiting from new fault tolerance for stable training.

    - Solved over 50 open math problems, including analysis, combinatorics, and number theory
    - Rediscovered the best-known solutions in 75% of cases
    - Improved upon known solutions in 20% of cases
- ByteDance takes the lead on vision models! Small (~21B) Seed1.5 beats behemoths like Claude 🔥
    - This model is, like many other Vision Language Models (VLM), a coupling of a vision encoder and an LLM part : it has 532M-parameter vision encoder coupled with a 20B-parameter Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) LLM.
    - => It's quite small, yet it reaches state-of-the-art results on most vision benchmarks, including GUI tasks, OCR, 3D localization.

    - It includes TTS features using volcengine for converting text to high-quality speech.
- **What’s new:** Microsoft released Phi-4-reasoning, Phi-4-reasoning-plus and Phi-4-mini-reasoning along with lessons learned in building the models.
- **What’s new:** A team at the model platform Together.AI and Agentica, an open-source project devoted to reinforcement learning (RL), released DeepCoder-14B-Preview. The release includes weights, code, dataset, training logs, and data optimizations under an MIT license that allows noncommercial and commercial uses
    - DeepCoder-14B-Preview’s optimizations reduced this complexity, shrinking RL training from months to weeks. Those optimizations are built into Verl-pipeline, an open source RL library from Together.AI and Agentica, giving developers a powerful tool for model training.

- New foundation model on image and video captioning just dropped by NVIDIA AI 🔥
- Describe Anything Model (DAM) is a 3B vision language model to generate detailed captions with localized references 😮
- Most of the vision LMs focus on image as a whole, lacking localized references in captions, and not taking in visual prompts (points, boxes, drawings around objects)
- DAM addresses this on two levels: new vision backbone that takes in focal crops and the image itself, and a large scale dataset 👀
- They generate a dataset by extending existing segmentation and referring expression generation datasets like REFCOCO, by passing in the images and classes to VLMs and generating captions.
- Lastly, they also release a new benchmark again with self-supervision, they use an LLM to evaluate the detailed captions focusing on localization 👏

- Hunyan 3D 2.0
- Deepseek R1 paper released
- Also DeepSeek 'cheated', it was trained on model output and thinks it is GPT-4, you cannot use output to develop models that compete with OpenAI( [https://openai.com/policies/row-terms-of-use/](https://openai.com/policies/row-terms-of-use/)). Stanford Alpaca ( [https://crfm.stanford.edu/2023/03/13/alpaca.html](https://crfm.stanford.edu/2023/03/13/alpaca.html)) was trained in 3 hrs on $600 of compute using data from model output, rather than a mess of datasets. Resulting Alpaca performance matched those of Llama and OpenAI. When training responses are consistent, the models learn more efficiently.

- UC Berkeley’s NovaSky team releases Sky-T1-32B-Preview, an open-source reasoning model that matches OpenAI’s o1-preview on key benchmarks. The model offers advanced reasoning in math and coding, achieving high performance with a training cost below $450.
    - We use our training data to fine tune Qwen2.5-32B-Instruct, an open source model without reasoning capabilities. The model is trained with 3 epochs, learning rate 1e-5 and batch size 96. The model training finishes in 19 hours on 8 H100 with DeepSpeed Zero-3 offload (~ $450 according to Lambda Cloud pricing). We use Llama-Factory to perform training.

### No Date
- Homebrew Labs released Ichigo, an opensource Llama 3 based advanced voice mode
    - Here's what makes it different:
    - **Direct Voice Processing**
        - ↳ No separate speech-to-text needed
        - ↳ No text-to-speech conversion
        - ↳ Everything happens in one model
    - **Multilingual Support**
        - ↳ Trained on diverse language data
        - ↳ Maintains 63.79 MMLU score
        - ↳ Handles accents naturally
    - **Smart Rejection**
        - ↳ Knows when audio is unclear
        - ↳ Won't guess at garbled speech
        - ↳ Actually tells you it can't understand
    - **Multi-turn Conversations**
        - ↳ Remembers context
        - ↳ Maintains natural flow
        - ↳ Learns from previous exchanges
