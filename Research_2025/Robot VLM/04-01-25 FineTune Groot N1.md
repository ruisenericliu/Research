Fine-tuning NVIDIA's Gr00t 2B robotic model with only 0.5% of the parameters using PEFT. I wrote this during the Seeed Studio's Embedded AI hackathon. Not everyone has H200s - Robotic research on commodity GPUs!

🚀 Thrilled to share that we won the Seeed EmbodiedAI Hackathon this weekend! It was an action-packed, learning-filled sprint where we pushed the limits of what’s possible with HuggingFace LeRobot and SO-100 Arms — fine-tuning Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models for pick/place and sorting tasks.🤖💡
 
Even more exciting: we trained our own arm of NVIDIA’s newly released GR00T N1 model, compared it against ACT and Pi0 and extended it to enable bimanual manipulation! 🧠🦾🦾
 
👉Huge shoutout to the dream team: Jason X., Chandravaran Kunjeti, Akshat Pandya, Nahid Alam, Anuj Agrawal, Vaibhav W.!
