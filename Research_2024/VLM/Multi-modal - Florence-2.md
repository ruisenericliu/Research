Fine-tune Florence-2 on any task 🔥  
Today we release a notebook and a walkthrough blog on fine-tuning Florence-2 on DocVQA dataset [Andrés Marafioti](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ACoAABMtPswBAkS3uzRn524-CwIjU70wXG44nSs) [Piotr Skalski](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ACoAAB5YNAMBHK3pXNcx81VZMKBhebx9gEOGUDA) 🔖

Florence-2 is a great vision-language model thanks to it's massive dataset and small size! 🤩  
This model requires conditioning through task prefixes and it's not as generalist, requiring fine-tuning on a new task, such as DocVQA. 📝  
We have fine-tuned the model on A100 (and one can also use a smaller GPU with smaller batch size) and saw that model picks up new tasks 🥹
