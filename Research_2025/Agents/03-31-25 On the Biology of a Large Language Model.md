I’ve only skimmed the paper - a long and dense read - but it’s already clear it’ll become a classic. What’s fascinating is that engineering is transforming into a science, trying to understand precisely how its own creations work 🤯
 
This shift is more profound than many realize. Engineering traditionally applied our understanding of the physical world, mathematics, and logic to build predictable things. But now, especially in fields like AI, we’ve built systems so complex we no longer fully understand them. We don’t even understand how they do simple things like additions!
 
We must now use scientific methods - originally designed to understand nature - to comprehend our own engineered creations. Mindblowing.
