Exciting news from Google DeepMind!
 
Their latest paper, "Video models are zero-shot learners and reasoners," shared on Hugging Face paper pages, introduces a breakthrough in vision AI with Veo 3.
 
Just as Large Language Models (LLMs) transformed natural language processing into a field of unified, generalist foundation models, Google DeepMind demonstrates that video models are on a similar trajectory for comprehensive visual understanding.
 
Veo 3 exhibits remarkable emergent zero-shot capabilities across a vast array of tasks it was never explicitly trained for. Imagine a single model that can:
 
Perceive the world by segmenting objects and detecting edges.
 
Model physical properties like gravity and buoyancy.
 
Manipulate images through style transfer and inpainting, or even simulate dexterous robot actions like opening a jar.
 
Reason visually to solve mazes and complete complex patterns.
 
This work signals a significant paradigm shift, showcasing how generative video models like Veo 3 are rapidly advancing towards becoming unified, generalist vision foundation models. We're thrilled to see such impactful research being shared on Hugging Face, making these innovations accessible to the community!
