Another robotics masterpiece from our friends from Disney Research!
 
Recent progress in physics-based character control has improved learning from unstructured motion data, but it's still hard to create a single control policy that handles diverse, unseen motions and works on real robots. To solve this, the team at Disney proposes a new two-stage technique.
 
In the first stage, an autoencoder is used to learn a latent space encoding from short motion clips. In the second stage, this encoding helps train a policy that maps kinematic input to dynamic output, ensuring accurate and adaptable movements.
 
By keeping these stages separate, the method benefits from better motion encoding and avoids common issues like mode collapse.
 
This technique has shown to be effective in simulations and has successfully brought dynamic motions to a real bipedal robot, marking an important step forward in robot control.
