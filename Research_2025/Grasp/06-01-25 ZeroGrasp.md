We propose a unified framework for 3D shape reconstruction and grasp pose prediction from a single RGB-D image — designed to generalize to unseen objects in the wild. And yes, ZeroGrasp sets a new state-of-the-art on the GraspNet-1B benchmark 🏆
 
As part of this work, we’re also releasing:  
✨ ZeroGrasp-11B dataset – a large-scale synthetic dataset for grasp prediction and reconstruction, built from 12K 3D models in the Objaverse-LVIS dataset  
✨ ReOcS dataset – a benchmark for evaluating 3D reconstruction under different levels of occlusion
 
📍 Join us at our poster session on Saturday, June 14, from 5-7 p.m. If you’re working on 3D vision, grasping, or generalizable robotics, I’d love to discuss and connect!
 
This project was made possible through a fantastic collaboration with TRI and Woven by Toyota — huge thanks for the support! 🙏
