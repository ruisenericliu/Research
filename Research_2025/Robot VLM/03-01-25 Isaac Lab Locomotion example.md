Task Description  
RL is remarkable, fully functional navigation using Reinforcement Learning (RL) in under 20 minutes—without any external sensors, relying solely on proprioception for blind navigation. This success highlights the power of Isaac Lab and Isaac Sim for rapid robot training and development.
 
How I Did It:  
1) Initial Training (10 minutes): Trained the Unitree H1 humanoid robot to walk stably using Isaac Lab’s pre-trained policies and RL workflows.  
2) Navigation Refinement (10 minutes): Leveraged checkpoints from the walking training, added custom rewards and navigation code, and trained for just 10 more minutes to achieve robust local navigation.
 
The Code:
