Unlock big-model performance through 𝐡𝐚𝐫𝐝𝐰𝐚𝐫𝐞+𝐬𝐨𝐟𝐭𝐰𝐚𝐫𝐞 𝐬𝐲𝐧𝐞𝐫𝐠𝐲.  
Mechanical intelligence + Medium-sized models = State-of-the-Art manipulation 🔥  
✨ 𝐑𝐨𝐛𝐮𝐬𝐭. 𝐀𝐟𝐟𝐨𝐫𝐝𝐚𝐛𝐥𝐞. 𝐃𝐈𝐘-𝐟𝐫𝐢𝐞𝐧𝐝𝐥𝐲. ✨  
Join our talk at the ICRA Award Finalist 1 Session (Tuesday, 10:15–10:20 AM).  
Highlights:
 
* PolyTouch integrates tactile sensing, peripheral vision, and contact acoustics, achieving top-tier performance without giant models!
 
* No fancy molds required: PolyTouch’s "secret ingredient" is simple 3M VHB tape ($10 on Amazon)—make the gel in just 5 minutes. Durable, affordable, easy!
 
* Robotics isn't just about bigger models; it’s about smart hardware + clever software working in synergy.
 
📌 Tactile sensing is 𝐥𝐨𝐰-𝐡𝐚𝐧𝐠𝐢𝐧𝐠 𝐟𝐫𝐮𝐢𝐭 to supercharge your manipulation tasks—try PolyTouch before scaling models up further!
