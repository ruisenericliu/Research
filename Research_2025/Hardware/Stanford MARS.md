It doesn’t look like much.  
But this small robot from Stanford might do for robotics what Apple II did for computing🧵
 
While everyone’s chasing $100,000 humanoids that barely walk, a tiny YC-backed team is quietly building the Personal Computer for embodied AI.
 
And it’s not a giant robot.
 
Big Tech treats robotics like a gated fortress...  
Closed, slow, and absurdly expensive.
 
If you’re a developer, you get a “base robot” and then spend months rebuilding the same systems from scratch. It kills innovation and keeps powerful AI out of builders’ hands.
 
That’s the problem Innate Robotics set out to solve.  
Founded by Axel Peytavin and Vignesh Anand (Stanford, YC F24), the team realized the future isn’t just better hardware.  
It’s teachable software: robotics that anyone can build on.
 
So they built MARS, the first Personal AI Robot.
 
It’s not a toy.  
It’s a $2,000 dev platform with a 6-DOF arm, 2D LiDAR, and a Jetson Orin Nano GPU:  
a complete system for researchers, makers, and developers.
 
But the real breakthrough isn’t the body.  
It’s the brain.
 
MARS runs BASIC, an onboard AI agent that can see, reason, remember, and act.  
Not a script, but a real-world OS for embodied intelligence.
 
It orchestrates:  
✅ Vision models to see  
✅ LLMs (like Llama 3 on Groq) to reason  
✅ Custom transformers to move  
✅ Spatial memory to remember
 
All running together... in real time.
 
You don’t need a PhD to use it.  
You can teach Mars a new skill (like tidying a desk or picking up objects) in under 30 minutes, just by showing it with your phone.
 
That’s the moment robotics becomes personal.
 
I asked Innate’s CEO and Co-founder, Axel Peytavin, what drives that speed.  
He said:
 
“Speed is objectively the most important thing in life.”
 
That mindset explains everything about how they work.
 
This isn’t some mega-corp R&D project.  
It’s a tiny, elite team from Stanford’s top AI labs (YC F24).
 
They’re shipping (first batch in Q4 2025) while Big Tech is still holding press conferences.  
That’s the startup velocity we need.
 
When PCs arrived, software exploded.  
When smartphones arrived, apps exploded.
 
Now Mars could do the same for embodied AI... built by a small Stanford team, not Big Tech.
 
🎧 I just sat down with Axel Peytavin, CEO & Co-Founder of Innate, on Building Deep Tech.  
We talked about how they built Mars, why openness matters, and what’s next for embodied AI.
