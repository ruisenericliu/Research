Bring Vision to Your Blind LLM! 👀
 
Ever wished your text-only LLM could understand images?  
"Vision as LoRA (VoRA)" makes it possible, efficiently and affordably! 🚀
 
VoRA transforms any LLM into a Multimodal Large Language Model (MLLM) using only vision embeddings and LoRA layers, eliminating costly external vision encoders. The magic? Block-wise distillation transfers visual knowledge from a pre-trained ViT directly into LoRA, boosted by bi-directional attention masks that capture full image context.
 
✨ Why VoRA stands out:  
‣ Cost-effective: Only lightweight vision embeddings and LoRA are trained.  
‣ Efficient distillation: Block-wise learning from a Vision Transformer (ViT).  
‣ Context-aware: Bidirectional masking ensures that all image patches within the same input are simultaneously visible, enhancing global image understanding
 
🚀 Results:  
‣ Matches conventional multimodal models with significantly fewer resources.  
‣ Seamlessly integrates visual capabilities without inflating inference costs or memory.
 
🔮 What's Next?  
Why stop at vision? Imagine enabling your favorite LLM to process audio or even videos, turning it into a true multimodal marvel!
