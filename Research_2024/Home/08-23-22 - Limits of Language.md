As Chomsky and his acolytes have [pointed out](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fpsyg.2015.01434/full) for decades, language is just not a clear and unambiguous vehicle for clear communication. But humans don’t _need_ a [perfect vehicle](https://www.basicbooks.com/titles/morten-h-christiansen/the-language-game/9781541674981/) for communication because we share a nonlinguistic understanding.
   

In LLMs, this involves the system discerning patterns at multiple levels in existing texts, seeing both how individual words are connected in the passage but also how the sentences all hang together within the larger passage which frames them.
 
critics are right to accuse these systems of being engaged in [a kind of mimicry](https://nautil.us/moving-beyond-mimicry-in-artificial-intelligence-21015/)
 
the knowledge is represented as context-sensitive know-how for coming up with a plausible sentence given the prior line
 
But the ability to _explain_ a concept linguistically is different from the ability to _use_ it practically.
 
they have the attention span and memory of roughly a paragraph --\> see Google research on infini-context
 
Other forms of knowledge:

1. Icon, graphs, maps
2. Artificats – non-linguisted mental simulation
3. Cultural knowledge - Social customers and rituals
    1. Icons and movements
 
This broader, context-sensitive kind of [learning and know-how](https://aclanthology.org/2020.emnlp-main.703/) is the more basic and ancient kind of knowledge, one which underlies the emergence of sentience in embodied critters and makes it possible to survive and flourish
 
The goal is for AI systems to focus on [the world](https://aclanthology.org/2020.acl-main.463/) being talked about, not the words themselves — but LLMs [don’t grasp the distinction](https://blogs.scientificamerican.com/observations/whats-still-lacking-in-artificial-intelligence/)
