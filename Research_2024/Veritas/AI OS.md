|**What's New**|
|AIOS (LLM Agent Operating System) is a new agent orchestration framework that embeds large language models into operating systems, creating an OS with a "brain" that can "understand".<br><br>  <br><br>AIOS is designed for optimal resource allocation, facilitating context switches, concurrent execution, tool services for agents, access control, and providing a rich toolkit for developers.<br><br>  <br><br>AIOS is based on several key agents that orchestrate the others. It consists of:<br><br>-  an **Agent Scheduler** for prioritizing agent requests, <br>- a **Context Manager** for managing interaction context, <br>- a **Memory Manager** for short-term memory, <br>- a **Storage Manager** for long-term data retention, <br>- a **Tool Manager** for managing external API tools, <br>- and a **Access Manager** for enforcing privacy and access control policies.<br><br>Those agents communicate with the AIOS SDK in an interactive mode, along with non-LLM tasks coming from the OS Kernel (with the Process scheduler, the memory manager, etc).<br><br>  <br><br>This architecture allows AIOS to integrate complex AI functionalities into traditional operating systems, enabling the development of more intelligent, responsive, and efficient applications that can leverage the full power of LLMs alongside conventional OS resources and capabilities.|
|**Why This Matters**|
|This approach is a shift in the way we interact with machines with agents deployed at the Operating System level that accomplish complex tasks. This trend is also demonstrated by Apple's ReALM models capable of understanding not only conversation, but also on-screen and background jobs information. This a new era of intelligent computing.|
|**Community Feedback**|
|**Andrey Karpathy:** _"Looking at LLMs as chatbots is the same as looking at early computers as calculators. We're seeing an emergence of a whole new computing paradigm, and it is very early." (09/23)_<br><br>  <br><br>**Carlos E. Perez:** _"AIOS constitutes a holistic platform to truly unleash the potential of LLM agents in the real world._|
