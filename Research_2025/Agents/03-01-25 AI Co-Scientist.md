The AI-Co Scientist paper dropped! The [Google](https://www.linkedin.com/company/google/) AI-Co Scientist is a Multi-Agent System build with [Google DeepMind](https://www.linkedin.com/company/googledeepmind/) Gemini 2.0 designed to generate scientific hypotheses through generate, debate, and evolve approach combining specialized agents and reasoning. The 80 page long paper includes prompts, example outputs and full reports generated by the AI-Co Scientist. 👀
 
Agents:  
\> Supervisor Agent: Orchestrates the research process, assigns tasks to agents, allocates resources to other agents based on the research plan.  
\> Generation Agent: Creates initial research hypotheses by exploring literature, simulated debates, and identifies testable assumptions.  
\> Reflection Agent: Reviews hypotheses (peer review), assesses correctness, quality, novelty, and potential to explain existing observations, with different review types.  
\> Ranking Agent: Creates pairwise comparisons of hypotheses (tournament-style), using simulated debates to create a Elo rating  
\> Evolution Agent: Refines best hypotheses by grounding them in literature, improving coherence/feasibility, combining ideas and exploring "out-of-the-box" thinking.  
\> Proximity Agent: Groups similar hypotheses to optimize exploration diversity.  
\> Meta-review Agent: Synthesizes insights from all reviews, identifies patterns, optimizes other agents' performance, and creates report
 
Implementation  
1️⃣ Scientist provides a research goal, e.g., "Find AML drug candidates".  
2️⃣ Supervisor Agent parses the research goal and creates a structured research plan.  
3️⃣ Generation Agent explores literature and engages in simulated debates to generate initial hypotheses.  
4️⃣ Reflection Agent identifies weaknesses via 6 review types (e.g., deep verification).  
5️⃣ Ranking Agent creates pairwise Elo tournaments through AI debates.  
6️⃣ Evolution Agent refines the top-ranked hypotheses.  
7️⃣ Meta-review Agent generates overview report and shares it with the Scientist.  
8️⃣ Scientist provides feedback, adds hypotheses for the next iteration.
 
Insights:  
🧠 Powered by Google Deepmind Gemini 2.0 models  
💡 Using Thinking/Reasoning Model boosted hypothesis quality by 300+ Elo points  
📈 Specialized agents, mimicking the scientific method, imporved hypothesis generation  
🔄 Self-improving loop: Meta-review feedback increased hypothesis novelty scores by 27%  
👥 Expert-in-the-loop design allows scientists to refine goals and provide feedback  
📝 Design of the prompts are a significant factor for performance  
👀 Paper includes prompts, example outputs and full reports generated  
🦠 Rediscovered (in 2 days) a bacterial gene transfer mechanism (took 10 years of manual) -\> not sure thats a fair comparison
