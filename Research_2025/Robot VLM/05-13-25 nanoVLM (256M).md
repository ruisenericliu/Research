We've just open-sourced nanoVLM, a pure PyTorch library for training Vision-Language Models (VLMs) from scratch — in just 750 lines of code! 🚀
 
With just 6 hours of training on a single NVIDIA H100 GPU, nanoVLM-222M achieves a 35.3% score on MMStar, matching SmolVLM-256M performance — but using 100x fewer GPU hours. 👀
 
You can even comfortably train nanoVLM in a free Google Colab notebook! 🤯
 
nanoVLM, inspired by Andrej Karpathy's nanoGPT, is designed to be simple, readable, and easily modifiable. The whole model is implemented in ~750 lines of code, and the training in ~200 lines of code.
 
It consists of a:  
🧠 SigLiP-ViT vision encoder  
🗣️ LLaMA-style language decoder  
🔁 Modality projection layer to connect vision and text
 
We'd love to see what you build with nanoVLM — share your creations with us! Links in the comments!
