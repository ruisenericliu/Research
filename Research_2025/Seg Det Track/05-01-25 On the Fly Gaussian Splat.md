With our image-based rendering research over the 20 years we overcame the rigidity of the multi-view stereo to allow truly realistic novel view synthesis with 3D Gaussian splatting. But the cost of camera calibration was still a major obstacle, especially for large scenes. We have made a significant step forward with our ACM Trans. on Graphics paper, to be presented at SIGGRAPH 2025: "On-the-fly Reconstruction for Large-Scale Novel View Synthesis from Unposed Images" where we jointly optimize cameras poses and 3D Gaussian Splats so fast that a good quality reconstruction is ready at the time you finish taking pictures.
