🚨 New CVPR 2025 Work — Can Vision-Language Models Self-Correct Semantic Grounding Errors?
 
**What if we could get large vision-language models (VLMs) to improve their own answers without retraining — just by thinking twice?**
 
📍 In our upcoming CVPR 2025 poster, we show that open-source VLMs, GPT-4V, and GPT-4o can self-correct semantic grounding mistakes through a training-free, agentic approach. That is:  
🤖 The model gives an answer... then turns around and verifies its own response.  
Why this matters:  
Prior work suggests LLMs can't reliably self-correct (ICLR’24, EMNLP’24)  
We challenge this: With well-structured, even binary feedback, test-time scaling emerges.
 
👀 Curious about system-2 thinking, feedback loops, or semantic grounding?  
🪧 Come see our poster to discuss:  
1. Self-correction works in VLMs/LLMs  
2. Why verification beats generation for reliable feedback  
3. How we automate the process — no humans in the loop!
