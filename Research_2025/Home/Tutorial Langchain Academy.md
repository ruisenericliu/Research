Many agents today follow the same simple pattern: run in a loop, call tools. That architecture works well enough, but it breaks down as tasks get more complex.  
Today, companies of all sizes – from startups to large enterprises – are building their own Deep Agents.
 
These agents dive deeper. They’re able to plan complex tasks and carry them out over longer time horizons.
 
There are four key features that set Deep Agents apart from regular agents:
 
1. Planning – keeps agents on track  
2. File system – allows agents to offload context  
3. Sub-agents – act as focused specialists  
4. Prompting – provides agents with detailed instructions
 
Our latest LangChain Academy course, Deep Agents with LangGraph, shows you how to combine these pieces with LangGraph to orchestrate long-running, multi-agent workflows.
