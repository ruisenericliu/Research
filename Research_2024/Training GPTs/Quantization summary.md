Do you want to learn about quantization? Here are five free resources to get started
 
1. A Visual Guide to Quantization.  
Very clear and intuitive by Maarten Grootendorst [https://lnkd.in/dpaK9bFj](https://lnkd.in/dpaK9bFj)
 
2. Introduction to Quantization cooked in 🤗 with 💗🧑‍🍳  
Nice introduction by Merve Noyan with simple code samples [https://lnkd.in/dwZhJb3r](https://lnkd.in/dwZhJb3r)
 
3. Quantization Fundamentals with Hugging Face  
An introductory video course from DeepLearning.AI and Hugging Face using PyTorch and Quanto  
[https://lnkd.in/dbKtGDCa](https://lnkd.in/dbKtGDCa)
 
4. Quantization in Depth  
A second short course that goes in much more depth and shows how to build quantizers from scratch  
[https://lnkd.in/d3CvCAUa](https://lnkd.in/d3CvCAUa)
 
5. Evaluating Quantization  
Evaluating quantization is not discussed as often, so I really like this blog post by Fireworks AI about how they evaluate their quantizations [https://lnkd.in/dx_UBm7A](https://lnkd.in/dx_UBm7A)
