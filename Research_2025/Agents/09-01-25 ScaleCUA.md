Huge news for the AI agent community!
 
Researchers from OpenGVLab and Shanghai AI Laboratory have just released ScaleCUA, a monumental step towards building truly general-purpose computer use agents.
 
Historically, developing robust AI agents capable of operating across diverse graphical user interfaces (GUIs) has been hampered by a lack of large-scale, open-source computer use data and foundational models.
 
ScaleCUA tackles this head-on by introducing an unparalleled, cross-platform dataset spanning 6 operating systems and 3 task domains. This massive dataset was built using an ingenious closed-loop pipeline that combines automated agents with human expert curation.
 
Trained on this data, the ScaleCUA models achieve state-of-the-art performance, demonstrating impressive gains across challenging benchmarks. Imagine an agent that can seamlessly navigate Windows, macOS, Linux, Android, and Web environments!
 
This release includes not only the paper but also the dataset, pre-trained models, and comprehensive training and evaluation code, all openly available on Hugging Face. It's a fantastic example of how open science and sharing artifacts on the Hugging Face Hub can accelerate research and drive innovation.
 
We encourage all researchers to dive into this work, explore the data, and build upon these powerful new foundations for cross-platform computer automation.
