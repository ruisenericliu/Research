3 Must Read RL Papers
 
This past year, I have been trying to expand my reading into the RL literature. However, it often felt overwhelming trying to keep track of a million papers making incremental improvements. I was looking for papers that asked fundamental questions and challenged the underlying assumptions of the field. Here are 3 papers that I found very insightful.
 
1. Three Dogmas of Reinforcement Learning

This paper questions underlying assumptions adopted by many RL practitioners such as representing tasks and objectives with a scalar reward and offers alternative perspectives.
 
2. Empirical Design in Reinforcement Learning

This paper challenges the standard practices in experimental design used in RL papers and presents multiple ways to enable more rigorous and fair experimental setup. It also introduces ways to effectively compare different variations of a policy and draw sound scientific conclusions.
 
3. Robot Learning as an Empirical Science: Best Practices for Policy Evaluation  
Link: [https://lnkd.in/eQ38C6ya](https://lnkd.in/eQ38C6ya)
 
This one focuses more on evaluation metrics and promotes more detailed and nuanced evaluation metrics when reporting performance of RL policies.
 
Happy holidays !
