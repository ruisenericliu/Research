🚀 Excited to share our new CVPR 2025 paper: AutoURDF!  
Manually designing robot models is tedious and time-consuming. We propose a fully unsupervised method to generate URDF files for unseen robots directly from time-series point cloud data—no motor signals or annotations needed.  
We validate AutoURDF on both synthetic and real-world robot scans.  
🛠️ It’s fully compatible with PyBullet and other simulators.  
This opens the door to scalable, automated robot modeling from purely visual data.
