Checkout our latest technical report, which details the use of the Cubify Anything dataset to enhance the spatial reasoning capabilities of multimodal large language models. We introduce a new dataset that, when combined with other multimodal fine-tuning datasets, results in state-of-the-art performance in spatial understanding tasks while maintaining competitive accuracy in other tasks. We call our model MM-Spatial.
