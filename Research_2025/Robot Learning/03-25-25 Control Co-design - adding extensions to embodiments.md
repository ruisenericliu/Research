🤖 What is control co-design? 🤖
 
Control co-design consists of applying control theory concepts to the joint design of a system and its control algorithms. This goes beyond the standard sequential approach in which the design is done first, and a control algorithm is then developed for the completely defined system.
 
⚡With control co-design techniques, the design of a robot can be informed by its closed-loop performance, leading to a co-optimization problem. This allows to reach optimal solutions that are not achievable otherwise.⚡
 
In the paper recently published on IEEE Robotics and Automation Letters, I describe a novel method for the co-design of cooperative, multi-quadcopter payload transport systems.  
I use ideas from optimal and robust control to optimize the configuration of the quadcopters around a payload of generic shape, and synthesize cooperative systems with enhanced robustness to disturbances!
