✨ CVPR 2025 highlight #2 --- EdgeTAM: On-Device Track Anything Model
 
EdgeTAM by Meta achieves significant speed-ups of 16 fps on an iPhone 15 Pro Max, ~22x faster than SAM2 on iPhone, while maintaining comparable performance to SAM2 on various video segmentation benchmarks
 
Key innovations from the paper are  
👉 2D Spatial Perceiver — a plug-in compressor for memory features  
👉 A 2-stage feature-level distillation from SAM2 aligning image encoder and memory attention
 
EdgeTAM achieves competitive scores on several benchmarks while being ~22x faster on edge devices
