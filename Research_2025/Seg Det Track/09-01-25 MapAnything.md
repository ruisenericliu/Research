Today we're releasing MapAnything - an end-to-end transformer architecture that directly regresses factored, metric 3D scene geometry.
 
We're supporting a range of different inputs - from up to 2,000 images in a single inference run, to all kinds of additional information like cameras & depth provided by other sensors or methods - and improve by 2x over state-of-the-art methods!
 
Our single, universal model enables SoTA for:  
🔥 Mono Depth Estimation  
🔥 Multi-View SfM  
🔥 Multi-View Stereo  
🔥 Depth Completion  
🔥 Registration
 
… and many more possibilities! - plus everything is Metric
 
We release code for data processing, training, benchmarking & ablations - everything Apache 2.0!
