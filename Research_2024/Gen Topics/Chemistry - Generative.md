Anyone interested in starting or ramping up in generative chemistry should read this paper and share it with their friends, students, and unrelated medicinal and computational chemists to help them get into the field.  
This is probably the most concise and useful review of generative AI in small molecule chemistry, which takes 20-30 min for experts to read but provides very deep insights (11 pages, mostly figures). If you want to see what published generative models and platforms worked experimentally for which targets and with what hit rates, you can print it out and get a cheat sheet. Of course, the most commercially tractable examples are rarely published but from what I can see - pretty much every published example was captured and scrutinized. This group reconstructed the timeline and did a gargantuan amount of work that an army of modern LLM agents would not be able to complete with a high degree of accuracy since many of the numbers are in image format and require additional processing.  
I was planning to write a review like this one day, but this group beat me to this and did a way better job as I saw some of the models I was not aware of.
